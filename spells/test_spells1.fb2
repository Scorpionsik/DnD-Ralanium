     <p>Acid fog creates a billowing mass of misty vapors similar to that produced by a <strong>solid fog</strong> spell (page 281). In addition to slowing creatures down and obscuring sight, this spell’s vapors are highly acidic. Each round on your turn, starting when you cast the spell, the fog deals 2d6 points of acid damage to each creature and object within it. </p>
     <p>Arcane Material Component: A pinch of dried, powdered peas combined with pow-dered animal hoof. </p>

     </title>
     <p><strong>Трансмутация [Air] </strong></p>
     <p><sup><strong>Уровень:</strong> Air 4, Clr 4, Drd 4 </sup></p>
     <p><sup><strong>Компоненты:</strong> V, S, DF </sup></p>
     <p><sup><strong>Время сотворения:</strong> 1 standard action </sup></p>
     <p><sup><strong>Дальность:</strong> Touch </sup></p>
     <p><sup><strong>Цель:</strong> Creature (Gargantuan or smaller) touched </sup></p>
     <p><sup><strong>Продолжительность:</strong> 10 min./level </sup></p>
     <p><sup><strong>Спасбросок:</strong> None </sup></p>
     <p><sup><strong>Сопротивление магии:</strong> Yes (harmless) </sup></p>
     <p>The subject can tread on air as if walking on solid ground. Moving upward is similar to walking up a hill. The maximum upward or downward angle possible is 45 degrees, at a rate equal to one-half the air walker’s normal speed. </p>
     <p>A strong wind (21+ mph) can push the subject along or hold it back. At the end of its turn each round, the wind blows the air walker 5 feet for each 5 miles per hour of wind speed. The creature can, at the DM’s option, be subject to additional penalties in exceptionally strong or turbulent winds, such as loss of control over movement or physical damage from being buffeted about. </p>
     <p>Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the dis-tance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall. Since dispelling a spell effect-tively ends it, the subject also descends in this way if the air walk spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by an antimagic field. </p>
     <p>You can cast air walk on a specially trained mount so it can be ridden through the air. You can train a mount to move with the aid of air walk (counts as a trick; see page 74) with one week of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check. </p>

     <p>Alarm sounds a mental or audible alarm each time a creature of Tiny or larger size enters the warded area or touches it. A creature that speaks the password (deter-mined by you at the time of casting) does not set off the alarm. You decide at the time of casting whether the alarm will be mental or audible. </p>
     <p>Mental Alarm: A mental alarm alerts you (and only you) so long as you remain within 1 mile of the warded area. You note a single mental “ping” that awakens you from normal sleep but does not otherwise disturb concentration. A silence spell has no effect on a mental alarm. </p>
     <p>Audible Alarm: An audible alarm pro-duces the sound of a hand bell, and anyone within 60 feet of the warded area can hear it clearly. Reduce the distance by 10 feet for each interposing closed door and by 20 feet for each substantial interposing wall. In quiet conditions, the ringing can be heard faintly as far as 180 feet away. The sound lasts for 1 round. Creatures within a silence spell cannot hear the ringing. Ethereal or astral creatures do not trig-ger the alarm. Alarm can be made permanent with a permanency spell. </p>
     <p>Arcane Focus: A tiny bell and a piece of very fine silver wire </p>

     <p>Align weapon makes a weapon good, evil, lawful, or chaotic, as you choose. A weapon that is aligned can bypass the damage reduction of certain creatures, usually out-siders of the opposite alignment. This spell has no effect on a weapon that already has an alignment, such as a holy sword. You can’t cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed strike. When you make a weapon good, evil, lawful, or chaotic, align weapon is a good, evil, lawful, or chaotic spell, respectively. </p>

     <p>You assume the form of a creature of the same type as your normal form (such as humanoid or magical beast). The new form must be within one size category of your normal size. The maximum HD of an assumed form is equal to your caster level, to a maximum of 5 HD at 5th level. You can change into a member of your own kind or even into yourself. You retain your own ability scores. Your class and level, hit points, alignment, base attack bonus, and base save bonuses all remain the same. You retain all supernatu-ral and spell-like special attacks and quali-ties of your normal form, except for those requiring a body part that the new form does not have (such as a mouth for a breath weapon or eyes for a gaze attack). You keep all extraordinary special attacks and qualities derived from class levels (such as a barbarian’s rage ability), but you lose any from your normal form that are not derived from class levels (such as a dragon’s frightful presence ability). If the new form is capable of speech, you can communicate normally. You retain any spellcasting ability you had in your original form, but the new form must be able to speak intelligibly (that is, speak a language) to use verbal components and must have limbs capable of fine manipu-lation to use somatic or material compo-nents. You acquire the physical qualities of the new form while retaining your own mind. Physical qualities include natural size, mundane movement capabilities (such as burrowing, climbing, walking, swimming, and flight with wings, to a maximum speed of 120 feet for flying or 60 feet for nonflying movement), natural armor bonus, natural weapons (such as claws, bite, and so on), racial skill bonuses, racial bonus feats, and any gross physical quali-ties (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, and so forth). A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You do not gain any extraordinary spe-cial attacks or special qualities not noted above under physical qualities, such as darkvision, low-light vision, blindsense, blindsight, fast healing, regeneration, scent, and so forth. You do not gain any supernatural special attacks, special qualities, or spell-like abilities of the new form. Your creature type and subtype (if any) remain the same regardless of your new form. You cannot take the form of any creature with a tem-plate, even if that template doesn’t change the creature type or subtype. You can freely designate the new form’s minor physical qualities (such as hair co-lor, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of that kind. The new form’s significant physical quali-ties (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under your control, but they must fall within the norms for the new form’s kind. You are effectively disguised as an average member of the new form’s race. If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your Disguise check. When the change occurs, your equip-ment, if any, either remains worn or held by the new form (if it is capable of wearing or holding the item), or melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional. When you revert to your true form, any objects previously melded into the new form reappear in the same location on your body they previously occupied and are once again functional. Any new items you wore in the assumed form and can’t wear in your normal form fall off and land at your feet; any that you could wear in either form or carry in a body part common to both forms (mouth, hands, or the like) at the time of reversion are still held in the same way. Any part of the body or piece of equipment that is separated from the whole reverts to its true form. </p>

     <p>You discern all spells and magical proper-ties present in a number of creatures or objects. Each round, you may examine a single creature or object that you can see as a free action. In the case of a magic item, you learn its functions, how to activate its functions (if appropriate), and how many charges are left (if it uses charges). In the case of an object or creature with active spells cast upon it, you learn each spell, its effect, and its caster level. An attended object may attempt a Will save to resist this effect if its holder so desires. If the save succeeds, you learn nothing about the object except what you can discern by looking at it. An object that makes its save cannot be affected by any other analyze dweomer spells for 24 hours. Analyze dweomer does not function when used on an artifact (see the Dungeon Master’s Guide for details on artifacts).</p>
     <p>Focus: A tiny lens of ruby or sapphire set in a small golden loop. The gemstone must be worth at least 1,500 gp. </p>

     <p><strong>Трансмутация </strong></p>

     <p><sup><strong>Дальность:</strong> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level) </sup></p>
     <p><sup><strong>Цели:</strong> Up to one animal (Gargantuan or smaller) per two levels, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart </sup></p>
     <p><sup><strong>Продолжительность:</strong> 1 min./level </sup></p>
     <p><sup><strong>Спасбросок:</strong> Fortitude negates </sup></p>
     <p><sup><strong>Сопротивление магии:</strong> Yes </sup></p>
     <p>A number of animals grow to twice their normal size and eight times their normal weight. This alteration changes each animal’s size category to the next largest (from Large to Huge, for example), grants it a +8 size bonus to Strength and a +4 size bonus to Constitution (and thus an extra 2 hit points per HD), and imposes a –2 size penalty to Dexterity. The creature’s existing natural armor bonus increases by 2. The size change also affects the animal’s modifier to AC and attack rolls and its base damage, as detailed on Table 2–2 in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. The animal’s space and reach change as indicated on Table 8–4: Creature Size and Scale (page 149), but its speed does not change. The spell also grants each subject damage reduction 10/magic and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it—the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size. All equipment worn or carried by an animal is similarly enlarged by the spell, though this change has no effect on the magical properties of any such equipment. Any enlarged item that leaves the enlarged creature’s possession instantly returns to its normal size. The spell gives no means of command or influence over the enlarged animals. Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack, which means (among other things) that you can’t use a second casting of this spell to further increase the size of an animal that’s still under the effect of the first casting. </p>

     <p><strong>Чары (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting] </strong></p>

     <p><sup><strong>Сопротивление магии:</strong> Yes </sup></p>
     <p>You compel a Tiny animal to go to a spot you designate. The most common use for this spell is to get an animal to carry a message to your allies. The animal cannot be one tamed or trained by someone else, including such creatures as familiars and animal companions. Using some type of food desirable to the animal as a lure, you call the animal to you. It advances and awaits your bidding. You can mentally impress on the animal a cer-tain place well known to you or an obvious landmark (such as the peak of a distant mountain). The directions must be simple, because the animal depends on your knowledge and can’t find a destination on its own. You can attach some small item or note to the messenger. The animal then goes to the designated location and waits there until the duration of the spell expires, whereupon it resumes its normal activities. During this period of waiting, the mes-senger allows others to approach it and remove any scroll or token it carries. Unless the intended recipient of a message is expecting a messenger in the form of a bird or other small animal, the carrier may be ignored. The intended recipient gains no special ability to communicate with the animal or read any attached message (if it’s written in a language he or she doesn’t know, for example).</p>
     <p>Material Component: A morsel of food the animal likes. </p>

     <p>As polymorph, except you polymorph up to one willing creature per caster level into an animal of your choice; the spell has no effect on unwilling creatures. All creatures must take the same kind of animal form; for example, you can’t turn one subject into a hawk and another into a dire wolf. Recipients remain in the animal form until the spell expires or until you dismiss it for all recipients. In addition, an individual subject may choose to resume its normal form as a full-round action; doing so ends the spell for that subject alone. The maximum HD of an assumed form is equal to the subject’s HD or your caster level, whichever is lower, to a maximum of 20 HD at 20th level. </p>

     <p>Your swaying motions and music (or singing, or chanting) compel animals and magical beasts to do nothing but watch you. Only a creature with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 can be fascinated by this spell. Roll 2d6 to determine the total number of HD worth of creatures that you fascinate. The closest targets are selected first until no more targets within range can be affected. For example, if Vadania affects 7 HD worth of animals and there are sev-eral 2 HD wolves within close range, only the three closest wolves are affected. A magical beast, a dire animal, or an an-imal trained to attack or guard is allowed a saving throw; an animal not trained to attack or guard is not. </p>

     <p>This spell turns the bones or bodies of dead creatures into undead skeletons or zombies that follow your spoken com-mands. The undead can follow you, or they can remain in an area and attack any creature (or just a specific kind of creature) entering the place. They remain animated until they are destroyed. (A destroyed skeleton or zombie can’t be animated again.) Regardless of the type of undead you create with this spell, you can’t create more HD of undead than twice your caster level with a single casting of animate dead. (The desecrate spell doubles this limit; see page 218.) The undead you create remain under your control indefinitely. No matter how many times you use this spell, however, you can control only 4 HD worth of undead creatures per caster level. If you exceed this number, all the newly created creatures fall under your control, and any excess undead from previous castings become uncontrolled. (You choose which creatures are released.) If you are a cleric, any undead you might command by virtue of your power to command or rebuke undead do not count toward the limit. Skeletons: A skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact corpse or skeleton. The corpse must have bones, so creating a skeleton from a purple worm, for example, is not possible. If a skeleton is made from a corpse, the flesh falls off the bones. The statistics for a skeleton depend on its size; they do not depend on what abilities the creature may have had while alive. The Monster Manual has game statistics for skeletons. Zombies: A zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse. The corpse must be that of a creature with a true anatomy, so a dead gelatinous cube, for example, cannot be animated as a zombie. The statistics for a zombie depend on its size, not on what abilities the creature may have had while alive. The Monster Manual has game statistics for zombies.</p>
     <p>Material Component: You must place a black onyx gem worth at least 25 gp per Hit Die of the undead into the mouth or eye socket of each corpse you intend to animate. The magic of the spell turns these gems into worthless, burned-out shells. </p>

     <p>You imbue inanimate objects with mobil-ity and a semblance of life. Each such ani-mated object then immediately attacks whomever or whatever you initially des-ignate. An animated object can be of any nonmagical material—wood, metal, stone, fabric, leather, ceramic, glass, or the like.. You may animate one Small or smaller object (such as a chair) or an equivalent number of larger objects per caster level. A Medium object (such as a coat rack) counts as two Small or smaller objects, a Large object (such as a table) as four, a Huge object as eight, a Gargantuan object as sixteen, and a Colossal object as thirty-two. You can change the designated target or targets as a move action, as if directing an active spell. The Monster Manual has game statistics for animated objects. This spell cannot animate objects car-ried or worn by a creature. Animate objects can be made permanent with a permanency spell. </p>

     <p>You imbue inanimate plants with mobility and a semblance of life. Each animated plant then immediately attacks whomever or whatever you initially designate as though it were an animated object of the appropriate size category. You may ani-mate one Large or smaller plant (such as a tree), or an equivalent number of larger plants, per three caster levels. A Huge plant counts as two Large or smaller plants, a Gargantuan plant as four, and a Colossal plant as eight. You can change the designated target or targets as a move action, as if directing an active spell. Use the statistics for animated objects found in the Monster Manual, except that plants smaller than Large don’t have hard-ness unless the DM rules otherwise for a given case. Animate plants cannot affect plant crea-tures (such as treants), nor does it affect nonliving vegetable material (such as a cotton tunic or hempen rope). Entangle: Alternatively, you may imbue all plants within range with a degree of mobility, which allows them to entwine around creatures in the area. This usage of the spell duplicates the effect of an entangle spell. Spell resistance does not keep crea-tures from being entangled. This effect lasts 1 hour per caster level. </p>

     <p>You can animate a nonliving ropelike object, such as string, yarn, cord, line, rope, or even a cable. The maximum length assumes a rope with a 1-inch diameter. Reduce the maximum length by 50% for every additional inch of thickness, and increase it by 50% for each reduction of the rope’s diameter by half. The possible commands are “coil” (form a neat, coiled stack), “coil and knot,” “loop,” “loop and knot,” “tie and knot,” and the opposites of all of the above (“uncoil,” and so forth). You can give one command each round as a move action, as if directing an active spell. The rope can enwrap only a creature or an object within 1 foot of it—it does not snake outward—so it must be thrown near the intended target. Doing so requires a successful ranged touch attack roll (range increment 10 feet). A typical 1-inch-diameter hempen rope has 2 hit points, AC 10, and requires a DC 23 Strength check to burst it. The rope does not deal damage, but it can be used as a trip line or to cause a single opponent that fails a Reflex saving throw to become entangled. A creature capable of spellcasting that is bound by this spell must make a DC 15 Concen-tration check to cast a spell. An entangled creature can slip free with a DC 20 Escape Artist check. The rope itself and any knots tied in it are not magical. This spell grants a +2 bonus on any Use Rope checks you make when using the transmuted rope. The spell cannot animate objects carried or worn by a creature. </p>

     <p>An invisible barrier surrounds you and moves with you. The space within this barrier is impervious to most magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magic items or spells within its confines. An antimagic field suppresses any spell or magical effect used within, brought into, or cast into the area, but does not dispel it. A hasted creature, for example, is not hasted while inside the field, but the spell resumes functioning when the creature leaves the field. Time spent within an antimagic field counts against the sup-pressed spell’s duration. Summoned creatures of any type and incorporeal undead wink out if they enter an antimagic field. They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. Time spent winked out counts normally against the duration of the conjuration that is maintaining the creature. If you cast antimagic field in an area occupied by a summoned creature that has spell resist-ance, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the creature’s spell resistance to make it wink out. (The effects of instantaneous conjurations, such as create water, are not affected by an antimagic field because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result.) A normal creature (a normally encoun-tered griffon rather than a conjured one, for instance) can enter the area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a magic sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword (and a masterwork sword at that). The spell has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been sum-moned, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures). Elemen-tals, corporeal undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned. These creatures’ spell-like or supernatural abilities, however, may be temporarily nullified by the field. Dispel magic does not remove the field. Two or more antimagic fields sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other. Certain spells, such as wall of force, prismatic sphere, and prismatic wall, remain unaffected by antimagic field (see the indi-vidual spell descriptions). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this. (See the Dungeon Master’s Guide for more about artifacts.) Should a creature be larger than the area enclosed by the barrier, any part of it that lies outside the barrier is unaffected by the field. </p>

     <p>You cause an object or location to emanate magical vibrations that repel either a specific kind of intelligent creature or creatures of a particular alignment, as defined by you. The kind of creature to be affected must be named specifically—for example, red dragons, hill giants, wererats, lammasus, cloakers, or vampires. A creature subtype (such as goblinoid) is not specific enough. Likewise, the specific alignment to be repelled must be named—for example, chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful neutral, or neutral. Creatures of the designated kind or alignment feel an overpowering urge to leave the area or to avoid the affected item. A compulsion forces them to abandon the area or item, shunning it and never will-ingly returning to it while the spell is in effect. A creature that makes a successful saving throw can stay in the area or touch the item but feels uncomfortable doing so. This distracting discomfort reduces the creature’s Dexterity score by 4 points. Antipathy counters and dispels sympathy. </p>

An arcane eye travels at 30 feet per round (300 feet per minute) if viewing an area ahead as a human would (primarily looking at the floor) or 10 feet per round (100 feet per minute) if examining the ceiling and walls as well as the floor ahead. It sees exactly as you would see if you were there. The eye can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. Solid barriers block its passage, but it can pass through a hole or space as small as 1 inch in diameter. The eye can’t enter another plane of existence, even through a gate or similar magical portal. You must concentrate to use an arcane eye. If you do not concentrate, the eye is inert until you again concentrate.</p>

     <p>This spell allows you to inscribe your per-sonal rune or mark, which can consist of no more than six characters. The writing can be visible or invisible. An arcane mark spell enables you to etch the rune upon any substance (even stone or metal) with-out harm to the material upon which it is placed. If an invisible mark is made, a detect magic spell causes it to glow and be visible, though not necessarily understandable. See invisibility, true seeing, a gem of seeing, or a robe of eyes likewise allows the user to see an invisible arcane mark. A read magic spell reveals the words, if any. The mark cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster or by an erase spell. If an arcane mark is placed on a living being, normal wear gradually causes the effect to fade in about a month. Arcane mark must be cast on an object prior to casting Drawmij’s instant summons on the same object (see that spell descrip-tion for details). </p>

     <p>This spell makes your eyes glow blue and allows you to see magical auras within 120 feet of you. The effect is similar to that of a detect magic spell, but arcane sight does not require concentration and discerns aura location and power more quickly. You know the location and power of all magical auras within your sight. An aura’s power depends on a spell’s functioning level or an item’s caster level, as noted in the description of the detect magic spell (page 219). If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + one-half caster level for a nonspell effect.) If you concentrate on a specific creature within 120 feet of you as a standard action, you can determine whether it has any spellcasting or spell-like abilities, whether these are arcane or divine (spell-like abilities register as arcane), and the strength of the most powerful spell or spell-like ability the creature currently has available for use. In some cases, arcane sight may give a deceptively low reading—for example, when you use it on a spellcaster who has used up most of his or her daily spell allotment. Arcane sight can be made permanent with a permanency spell. </p>

     <p>By freeing your spirit from your physical body, this spell allows you to project an astral body onto another plane altogether. You can bring the astral forms of other willing creatures with you, provided that these subjects are linked in a circle with you at the time of the casting. These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and must accompany you at all times. If something happens to you during the journey, your companions are stranded wherever you left them. You project your astral self onto the Astral Plane, leaving your physical body behind on the Material Plane in a state of suspended animation. The spell projects an astral copy of you and all you wear or carry onto the Astral Plane. Since the Astral Plane touches upon other planes, you can travel astrally to any of these other planes as you will. To enter one, you leave the Astral Plane, forming a new physical body (and equipment) on the plane of existence you have chosen to enter. While you are on the Astral Plane, your astral body is connected at all times to your physical body by a silvery cord. If the cord is broken, you are killed, astrally and phys-ically. Luckily, very few things can destroy a silver cord (see the Dungeon Master’s Guide for more information). When a second body is formed on a different plane, the incorporeal silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the second body or the astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to your body where it rests on the Material Plane, thereby reviving it from its state of suspended animation. Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral Plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral Plane; a physical body must be material-ized on other planes. You and your companions may travel through the Astral Plane indefinitely. Your bodies simply wait behind in a state of suspended animation until you choose to return your spirits to them. The spell lasts until you desire to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as dispel magic cast upon either the physical body or the astral form, the breaking of the silver cord, or the destruction of your body back on the Material Plane (which kills you).</p>

     <p>This spell removes the burden of evil acts or misdeeds from the subject. The creature seeking atonement must be truly repentant and desirous of setting right its misdeeds. If the atoning creature com-mitted the evil act unwittingly or under some form of compulsion, atonement operates normally at no cost to you. How-ever, in the case of a creature atoning for deliberate misdeeds and acts of a knowing and willful nature, you must intercede with your deity (requiring you to expend 500 XP) in order to expunge the subject’s burden. Many casters first assign a subject of this sort a quest (see geas/quest) or similar penance to determine whether the creature is truly contrite before casting the atonement spell on its behalf. Atonement may be cast for one of several purposes, depending on the version selected. Reverse Magical Alignment Change: If a creature has had its alignment magically changed, atonement returns its alignment to its original status at no cost in experi-ence points. Restore Class: A paladin who has lost her class features due to committing an evil act may have her paladinhood restored to her by this spell. Restore Cleric or Druid Spell Powers: A cleric or druid who has lost the ability to cast spells by incurring the anger of his or her deity may regain that ability by seek-ing atonement from another cleric of the same deity or another druid. If the trans-gression was intentional, the casting cleric loses 500 XP for his intercession. If the transgression was unintentional, he does not lose XP. Redemption or Temptation: You may cast this spell upon a creature of an opposing alignment in order to offer it a chance to change its alignment to match yours. The prospective subject must be present for the entire casting process. Upon completion of the spell, the subject freely chooses whether it retains its original alignment or acquiesces to your offer and changes to your alignment. No duress, compulsion, or magical influence can force the subject to take advantage of the opportunity offered if it is unwilling to abandon its old alignment. This use of the spell does not work on outsiders or any creature incapable of changing its alignment naturally. Though the spell description refers to evil acts, atonement can also be used on any creature that has performed acts against its alignment, whether those acts are evil, good, chaotic, or lawful. Note: Normally, changing alignment is up to the player (for PCs) or the DM (for NPCs). This use of atonement simply offers a believable way for a character to change his or her alignment drastically, suddenly, and definitively.</p>
     <p>Material Component: Burning incense.</p>
     <p>Focus: In addition to your holy symbol or normal divine focus, you need a set of prayer beads (or other prayer device, such as a prayer wheel or prayer book) worth at least 500 gp. </p>
     <p>XP Cost: When cast for the benefit of a creature whose guilt was the result of deliberate acts, the cost to you is 500 XP per casting (see above). </p>

The DM may determine that a question is so straightforward that a suc-cessful result is automatic, or so vague as to have no chance of success. If the augury succeeds, you get one of four results: Weal (if the action will probably bring good results). Woe (for bad results). Weal and woe (for both). Nothing (for actions that don’t have especially good or bad results). If the spell fails, you get the “nothing” result. A cleric who gets the “nothing” result has no way to tell whether it was the consequence of a failed or successful augury. The augury can see into the future only about half an hour, so anything that might happen after that does not affect the result. Thus, the result might not take into account the long-term consequences of a contemplated action. All auguries cast by the same person about the same topic use the same dice result as the first casting.</p>

     <p>You awaken a tree or animal to humanlike sentience. To succeed, you must make a Will save (DC 10 + the animal’s current HD, or the HD the tree will have once awakened). The awakened animal or tree is friendly toward you. You have no special empathy or connection with a creature you awaken, although it serves you in specific tasks or endeavors if you communicate your desires to it. An awakened tree has characteristics as if it were an animated object (see the Monster Manual), except that it gains the plant type and its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are each 3d6. An awakened plant gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it has senses similar to a human’s. An awakened animal gets 3d6 Intel-ligence, +1d3 Charisma, and +2 HD. Its type becomes magical beast (augmented animal). An awakened animal can’t serve as an animal companion, familiar, or special mount. An awakened tree or animal can speak one language that you know, plus one additional language that you know per point of Intelligence bonus (if any). </p>

If the new form would prove fatal to the creature (for example, if you polymorphed a landbound target into a fish, or a flying target into a toad) the subject gets a +4 bonus on the save. If the spell succeeds, the subject must also make a Will save. If this second save fails, the creature loses its extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities, loses its ability to cast spells (if it had the ability), and gains the alignment, special abilities, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores of its new form in place of its own. It still retains its class and level (or HD), as well as all benefits deriving therefrom (such as base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points). It retains any class features (other than spellcasting) that aren’t extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like abilities. Incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to being polymorphed, and a crea-ture with the shapechanger subtype (such as a lycanthrope or a doppelganger) can revert to its natural form as a standard action. </p>

     <p>A banishment spell is a more powerful ver-sion of the dismissal spell. It enables you to force extraplanar creatures out of your home plane. As many as 2 Hit Dice of creatures per caster level can be banished. You can improve the spell’s chance of suc-cess by presenting at least one object or substance that the target hates, fears, or otherwise opposes. For each such object or substance, you gain a +1 bonus on your caster level check to overcome the target’s spell resistance (if any), the saving throw DC increases by 2. For example, if this spell were cast on a demon that hated light and was vulnerable to holy water and cold iron weapons, you might use iron, holy water, and a torch in the spell. The three items would give you a +3 bonus on your check to overcome the demon’s spell resistance and add 6 to the spell’s save DC. At the DM’s option, certain rare items might work twice as well as a normal item for the purpose of the bonuses (each pro-viding a +2 bonus on the caster level check against spell resistance and increasing the save DC by 4). </p>

     <p>This spell functions like Bigby’s interposing hand, except that the hand can interpose itself, push, or strike one opponent that you select. The floating hand can move as far as 60 feet and can attack in the same round. Since this hand is directed by you, its ability to notice or attack invisible or concealed creatures is no better than yours. The hand attacks once per round, and its attack bonus equals your caster level + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (for a wizard, cleric, or sorcerer, respectively), +11 for the hand’s Strength score (33), –1 for being Large. The hand deals 1d8+11 points of damage on each attack, and any creature struck must make a Fortitude save (against this spell’s save DC) or be stunned for 1 round. Directing the spell to a new target is a move action. The clenched fist can also interpose itself as Bigby’s interposing hand does, or it can bull rush an opponent as Bigby’s forceful hand does, but at a +15 bonus on the Strength check.

Treat this attack as a bull rush with a +14 bonus on the Strength check (+8 for Strength 27, +4 for being Large, and a +2 bonus for charging, which it always gets). The hand always moves with the opponent to push that target back the full distance allowed, and it has no speed limit. Directing the spell to a new target is a move action. A very strong creature could not push the hand out of its way because the latter would instantly reposition itself between the creature and you, but an opponent could push the hand up against you by successfully bull rushing it.</p>

     <p>Bigby’s Interposing hand creates a Large magic hand that appears between you and one opponent. This floating, disembodied hand then moves to remain between the two of you, regardless of where you move or how the opponent tries to get around it, providing cover (+4 AC) for you against that opponent. Nothing can fool the hand—it sticks with the selected oppo-nent in spite of darkness, invisibility, polymorphing, or any other attempt at hiding or disguise. The hand does not pursue an opponent, however. A Bigby’s hand is 10 feet long and about that wide with its fingers outstretched. It has as many hit points as you do when you’re undamaged, and its AC is 20 (–1 size, +11 natural). It takes damage as a normal creature, but most magical effects that don’t cause damage do not affect it. The hand never provokes attacks of op-portunity from opponents. It cannot push through a wall of force or enter an antimagic field, but it suffers the full effect of a prismatic wall or prismatic sphere. The hand makes saving throws as its caster. Disintegrate or a successful dispel magic destroys it. Any creature weighing 2,000 pounds or less that tries to push past the hand is slowed to half its normal speed. The hand cannot reduce the speed of a creature weighing more than 2,000 pounds, but it still affects the creature’s attacks. Directing the spell to a new target is a move action.</p>

     <p>A binding spell creates a magical restraint to hold a creature. The target gets an initial saving throw only if its Hit Dice equal at least one-half your caster level. You may have as many as six assistants help you with the spell. For each assistant who casts suggestion, your caster level for this casting of binding increases by 1. For each assistant who casts dominate animal, dominate person, or dominate monster, your caster level for this casting of binding increases by a number equal to one-third of that assistant’s level, provided that the spell’s target is appropriate for a binding spell. Since the assistants’ spells are cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of the binding spell, saving throws and spell resistance against the assistants’ spells are irrelevant. Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial Will saving throw and how long the binding lasts. All binding spells are dis-missible. Regardless of the version of binding you cast, you can specify triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur. These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature’s name, identity, or alignment but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, or hit points don’t qualify. For example, a bound creature can be released when a lawful good creature approaches, but not when a paladin approaches. Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot be changed. Setting a release condition increases the save DC (assuming a saving throw is allowed) by 2. If you are casting any of the first three versions of binding (those with limited durations), you may cast additional binding spells to prolong the effect, since the durations overlap. If you do so, the target gets a saving throw at the end of the first spell’s duration, even if your caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving throw. If the creature succeeds on this save, all the binding spells it has received are broken. The binding spell has six versions. Choose one of the following versions when you cast the spell. </p>
     <p>Chaining: The subject is confined by restraints that generate an antipathy spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except you. The duration is one year per caster level. The subject of this form of binding is confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell. </p>
     <p>Slumber: This version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as one year per caster level. The subject does not need to eat or drink while slumbering, nor does it age. This form of binding is more difficult to cast than chaining, making it slightly easier to resist. Reduce the spell’s save DC by 1. </p>
     <p>Bound Slumber: This combination of chaining and slumber lasts for as long as one month per caster level. Reduce the save DC by 2. </p>
     <p>Hedged Prison: The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area (such as a labyrinth) from which it cannot wander by any means. The effect is permanent. Reduce the save DC by 3. </p>
     <p>Metamorphosis: The subject assumes gaseous form, except for its head or face. It is held harmless in a jar or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose. The creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities. The binding is per-manent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while metamorphosed, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4. </p>
     <p>Minimus Containment: The subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or even less and held within some gem, jar, or similar object. The binding is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while contained, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4. You can’t dispel a binding spell with dispel magic or a similar effect, though an antimagic field or Mordenkainen’s disjunction affects it normally. A bound extraplanar creature cannot be sent back to its home plane due to dismissal, banishment, or a similar effect. </p>
     <p><strong>Components:</strong> The components for a binding spell vary according to the version of the spell, but they always include a continuous chanting utterance read from the scroll or spellbook page containing the spell, somatic gestures, and materials appropriate to the form of binding used. These components can include such items as miniature chains of special metals (silver for lycanthropes, cold iron for demons, and so forth), soporific herbs of the rarest sort (for slumber bindings), a bell jar of the finest crystal, and the like. In addition to the specially made props suited to the specific type of binding (cost 500 gp), the spell requires opals worth at least 500 gp for each HD of the target and a vellum depiction or carved statuette of the subject to be captured. </p>

     <p>Any nonevil creature within the area of a blasphemy spell suffers the following ill effects. HD Effect Equal to caster level Dazed Up to caster level –1 Weakened, dazed Up to caster level –5 Paralyzed, weakened, dazed Up to caster level –10 Killed, paralyzed, weakened, dazed The effects are cumulative and concurrent. No saving throw is allowed against these effects. Dazed: The creature can take no actions for 1 round, though it defends itself nor-mally. Weakened: The creature’s Strength score decreases by 2d6 points for 2d4 rounds. Paralyzed: The creature is paralyzed and helpless for 1d10 minutes. Killed: Living creatures die. Undead creatures are destroyed. Furthermore, if you are on your home plane when you cast this spell, nonevil extraplanar creatures within the area are instantly banished back to their home planes. Creatures so banished cannot re-turn for at least 24 hours. This effect takes place regardless of whether the creatures hear the blasphemy. The banishment effect allows a Will save (at a –4 penalty) to negate. Creatures whose Hit Dice exceed your caster level are unaffected by blasphemy. </p>

     <p>This transmutation makes a weapon strike true against evil foes. The weapon is treated as having a +1 enhancement bonus for the purpose of bypassing the damage reduction of evil creatures or striking evil incorporeal creatures (though the spell doesn’t grant an actual enhancement bonus). The weapon also becomes good, which means it can bypass the damage reduction of certain creatures, particularly evil outsiders. (This effect overrides and suppresses any other alignment the weapon might have.) Individual arrows or bolts can be transmuted, but affected projectile weapons (such as bows) don’t confer the benefit to the projectiles they shoot. In addition, all critical hit rolls against evil foes are automatically successful, so every threat is a critical hit. This last effect does not apply to any weapon that already has a magical effect related to critical hits, such as a keen weapon or a vorpal sword. </p>

     <p>Like a blink dog (see the Monster Manual), you “blink” back and forth between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane. You look as though you’re winking in and out of reality very quickly and at random. Blinking has several effects, as follows. Physical attacks against you have a 50% miss chance, and the Blind-Fight feat doesn’t help opponents, since you’re ethe-real and not merely invisible. If the attack is capable of striking ethereal creatures, the miss chance is only 20% (for conceal-ment). If the attacker can see invisible creatures, the miss chance is also only 20%. (For an attacker who can both see and strike ethereal creatures, there is no miss chance.) Likewise, your own attacks have a 20% miss chance, since you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike. Any individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against you while you’re blinking unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures. Your own spells have a 20% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material Plane. While blinking, you take only half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane). You strike as an invisible creature (with a +2 bonus on attack rolls), denying your target any Dexterity bonus to AC. You take only half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material. While blinking, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50% chance that you become material. If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled. You can move at only three-quar-ters speed (because movement on the Ethereal Plane is at half speed, and you spend about half your time there and half your time material.) Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures. You interact with ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact with material ones. For instance, your spells against ethereal creatures are 20% likely to activate just as you go material and be lost. An ethereal creature is invisible, incor-poreal, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down. As an incor-poreal creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures. An ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and insubstantial. Sight and hearing on the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet. Force effects (such as magic missile and wall of force) and abjurations affect you normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can’t attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane (such as the basilisk and its gaze attack. Treat other ethereal creatures and objects as material. </p>

     <p>The subject’s outline appears blurred, shifting and wavering. This distortion grants the subject concealment (20% miss chance). A see invisibility spell does not counteract the blur effect, but a true seeing spell does. Opponents that cannot see the subject ignore the spell’s effect (though fighting an unseen opponent carries penalties of its own; see page 151). The subject of a blur spell. </p>

     <p>This spell frees victims from enchant-ments, transmutations, and curses. Break enchantment can reverse even an instanta-neous effect, such as flesh to stone. For each such effect, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect. Success means that the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect. For a cursed magic item, the DC is 25. If the spell is one that cannot be dis-pelled by dispel magic, break enchantment works only if that spell is 5th level or lower. For instance, bestow curse cannot be dispelled by dispel magic, but break enchant-ment can dispel it. If the effect comes from some perma-nent magic item, such as a cursed sword, break enchantment does not remove the curse from the item, but it does frees the victim from the item’s effects. For example, a cursed item can change the alignment of its user. Break enchantment allows the victim to be rid of the item and negates the alignment change, but the item’s curse is intact and affects the next creature to pick up the item—even if it’s the recent recipient of the break enchant-ment spell. </p>

     <p>Immediately upon completion of the spell, and once per round thereafter, you may call down a 5-foot-wide, 30-foot-long, vertical bolt of lightning that deals 3d6 points of electricity damage. The bolt of lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke at whatever target point you choose within the spell’s range (measured from your position at the time). Any creature in the target square or in the path of the bolt is affected. You need not call a bolt of lightning immediately; other actions, even spell-casting, can be performed. However, each round after the first you may use a stan-dard action (concentrating on the spell) to call a bolt. You may call a total number of bolts equal to your caster level (maximum 10 bolts). If you are outdoors and in a stormy area—a rain shower, clouds and wind, hot and cloudy conditions, or even a tornado (including a whirlwind formed by a djinni or an air elemental of at least Large size; see the Monster Manual)—each bolt deals 3d10 points of electricity damage instead of 3d6.

All the subjects must be of the same kind, and no two may be more than 30 feet apart. The maximum number of Hit Dice of animals you can affect is equal to 2d4 + caster level. A dire animal or an animal trained to attack or guard is allowed a saving throw; other animals are not. (A druid could calm a normal bear or wolf with little trouble, but it’s more difficult to affect a trained guard dog.) The affected creatures remain where they are and do not attack or flee. They are not helpless and defend themselves nor-mally if attacked. Any threat (such as fire, a hungry predator, or an imminent attack) breaks the spell on the threatened crea-tures. </p>

     <p>This spell calms agitated creatures. You have no control over the affected creatures, but calm emotions can stop raging creatures from fighting or joyous ones from reveling. Creatures so affected cannot take violent actions (although they can defend themselves) or do anything destructive. Any aggressive action against or damage dealt to a calmed creature immediately breaks the spell on all calmed creatures. This spell automatically suppresses (but does not dispel) any morale bonuses granted by spells such as bless, good hope, and rage, as well as negating a bard’s ability to inspire courage or a barbarian’s rage ability. It also suppresses any fear effects and removes the confused condition from all targets. While the spell lasts, a sup-pressed spell or effect has no effect. When the calm emotions spell ends, the original spell or effect takes hold of the creature again, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime. </p>

     <p>This spell creates an electrical discharge that begins as a single stroke commencing from your fingertips. Unlike lightning bolt, chain lightning strikes one object or creature initially, then arcs to other targets. The bolt deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to the primary target. After it strikes, lightning can arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your caster level (max-imum 20). The secondary bolts each strike one target and deal half as much damage as the primary one did (rounded down). For example, a 19th-level sorcerer generates a primary bolt (19d6 points of damage) and as many as nineteen secondary bolts (each of which deals half as much as the primary bolt dealt). Each target can attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage. You choose secondary targets as you like, but they must all be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no target can be struck more than once. You can choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the max-imum (to avoid allies in the area, for example).</p>
     <p>Focus: A bit of fur; a piece of amber, glass, or a crystal rod; plus one silver pin for each of your caster levels. </p>

     <p>You change a specially prepared quarter-staff into a Huge treantlike creature, about 24 feet tall. When you plant the end of the staff in the ground and speak a special command to conclude the casting of the spell, your staff turns into a creature that looks and fights just like a treant (see the Monster Manual). The staff-treant defends you and obeys any spoken commands. However, it is by no means a true treant; it cannot converse with actual treants or control trees. If the staff-treant is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it crumbles to powder and the staff is destroyed. Otherwise, the staff returns to its normal form when the spell duration expires (or when the spell is dismissed), and it can be used as the focus for another casting of the spell. The staff-treant is always at full strength when created, despite any wounds it may have incurred the last time it appeared.</p>
     <p>Focus: The quarterstaff, which must be specially prepared. The staff must be a sound limb cut from an ash, oak, or yew, then cured, shaped, carved, and polished (a process requiring twenty-eight days). You cannot adventure or engage in other strenuous activity during the shaping and carving of the staff. </p>

     <p>You unleash chaotic power to smite your enemies. The power takes the form of a multicolored explosion of leaping, rico-cheting energy. Only lawful and neutral (not chaotic) creatures are harmed by the spell. The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to lawful creatures (or 1d6 points of damage per caster level, maximum 10d6, to lawful outsiders) and slows them for 1d6 rounds. A slowed creature can take only a single standard action or move action on each of its turns, plus free actions as normal. In addition, it takes a –2 penalty to AC, attack rolls, damage rolls, and Reflex saves. A suc-cessful Will save reduces the damage by half and negates the slow effect. The spell deals only half damage against creatures who are neither lawful nor chaotic, and they are not slowed. Such a creature can reduce the damage by half again (down to one-quarter) with a suc-cessful Will save. </p>

     <p>This charm makes a humanoid creature regard you as its trusted friend and ally (treat the target’s attitude as friendly; see Influencing NPC Attitudes, page 72). If the creature is currently being threatened or attacked by you or your allies, however, it receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw. The spell does not enable you to control the charmed person as if it were an automaton, but it perceives your words and actions in the most favorable way. You can try to give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn’t ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) An affected creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but a charmed fighter, for example, might believe you if you assured him that the only chance to save your life is for him to hold back an onrushing red dragon for “just a few seconds.” Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the charmed person breaks the spell. You must speak the person’s language to communicate your commands, or else be good at panto-miming. </p>

     <p><sup><strong>Сопротивление магии:</strong> Yes (object) </sup></p>
     <p>Chill metal makes metal extremely cold. Unattended, nonmagical metal gets no saving throw. Magical metal is allowed a saving throw against the spell (Magic item’s saving throws are covered in the Dungeon Master’s Guide.) An item in a crea-ture’s possession uses the creature’s saving throw bonus unless its own is higher. A creature takes cold damage if its equipment is chilled. It takes full damage if its armor is affected or if it is holding, touching, wearing, or carrying metal weighing one-fifth of its weight. The crea-ture takes minimum damage (1 point or 2 points; see the table) if it’s not wearing metal armor and the metal that it’s carry-ing weighs less than one-fifth of its weight. On the first round of the spell, the metal becomes chilly and uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage. The same effect also occurs on the last round of the spell’s duration. During the second (and also the next-to-last) round, icy coldness causes pain and damage. In the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is freezing cold, causing more damage, as shown on the table below. Metal Round Temperature Damage 1 Cold None 2 Icy 1d4 points 3–5 Freezing 2d4 points 6 Icy 1d4 points 7 Cold None Any heat intense enough to damage the creature negates cold damage from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-for-point basis. For example, if the damage roll from a chill metal spell indicates 5 points of cold damage and the subject plunges through a wall of fire in the same round and takes 8 points of fire damage, it winds up taking no cold damage and only 3 points of fire damage. Underwater, chill metal deals no damage, but ice immediately forms around the affected metal, making it more buoyant. Chill metal counters and dispels heat metal. </p>

     <p>Clairaudience/clairvoyance creates an invis-ible magical sensor at a specific location that enables you to hear or see (your choice) almost as if you were there. You don’t need line of sight or line of effect, but the locale must be known—a place familiar to you or an obvious one, such as behind a door, around a corner, or in a grove of trees. Once you have selected the locale, the sensor doesn’t move, but you can rotate it in all directions to view the area as desired. Unlike other scrying spells, this spell does not allow magically or supernaturally enhanced senses to work through it. If the chosen locale is magically dark, you see nothing. If it is naturally pitch black, you can see in a 10- foot radius around the center of the spell’s effect. Clairaudience/clairvoyance functions only on the plane of existence you are currently occupying. </p>

     <p>A random pattern of color surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by lawful creatures, and causing lawful crea-tures that strike the subjects to become confused. This abjuration has four effects. First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike protection from law, the benefit of this spell applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by lawful creatures. Second, each warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against lawful spells and spells cast by lawful creatures. Third, the abjuration blocks possession and mental influence, just as protection from law does. Finally, if a lawful creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the offending attacker is confused for 1 round (Will save negates, as with the con-fusion spell, but against the save DC of cloak of chaos).</p>

     <p>This spell makes an inert duplicate of a creature. If the original individual has been slain, its soul immediately transfers to the clone, creating a replacement (pro-vided that the soul is free and willing to return; see Bringing Back the Dead, page 171). The original’s physical remains, should they still exist, become inert and cannot thereafter be restored to life. If the original creature has reached the end of its natural life span (that is, it has died of natural causes), any cloning attempt fails. To create the duplicate, you must have a piece of flesh (not hair, nails, scales, or the like) with a volume of at least 1 cubic inch that was taken from the original creature’s living body. The piece of flesh need not be fresh, but it must be kept from rotting (for example, by the gentle repose spell). Once the spell is cast, the duplicate must be grown in a laboratory for 2d4 months. When the clone is completed, the origi-nal’s soul enters it immediately, if that creature is already dead. The clone is phys-ically identical with the original and pos-sesses the same personality and memories as the original. In other respects, treat the clone as if it were the original character raised from the dead, including the loss of one level or 2 points of Constitution (if the original was a 1st-level character). If this Constitution adjustment would give the clone a Constitution score of 0, the spell fails. If the original creature has lost levels since the flesh sample was taken and died at a lower level than the clone would oth-erwise be, the clone is one level below the level at which the original died. The spell duplicates only the original’s body and mind, not its equipment. A duplicate can be grown while the original still lives, or when the original soul is unavailable, but the resulting body is merely a soulless bit of inert flesh, which rots if not preserved.</p>

     <p><sup><strong>Сопротивление магии:</strong> No </sup></p>
     <p>This spell generates a bank of fog, similar to a fog cloud, except that its vapors are yel-lowish green and poisonous. These vapors automatically kill any living creature with 3 or fewer HD (no save). A living creature with 4 to 6 HD is slain unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save (in which case it takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage on your turn each round while in the cloud). A living creature with 6 or more HD takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage on your turn each round while in the cloud (a successful Fortitude save halves this damage). Holding one’s breath doesn’t help, but creatures immune to poison are unaffected by the spell. Unlike a fog cloud, the cloudkill moves away from you at 10 feet per round, rolling along the surface of the ground. Figure out the cloud’s new spread each round based on its new point of origin, which is 10 feet farther away from the point of origin where you cast the spell. Because the vapors are heavier than air, they sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down den or sinkhole open-ings; thus, the spell is ideal for slaying hives of giant ants, for example. It cannot penetrate liquids, nor can it be cast under-water. </p>

It may act normally while prone but takes any appropriate penalties. Flee: On its turn, the subject moves away from you as quickly as possible for 1 round. It may do nothing but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of oppor-tunity for this movement as normal. Halt: The subject stands in place for 1 round.

     <p>This spell allows you some degree of con-trol over one or more plant creatures. Affected plant creatures can understand you, and they perceive your words and actions in the most favorable way (treat their attitude as friendly). They will not attack you while the spell lasts. You can try to give a subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn’t ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) A commanded plant never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing (see charm person). You can affect a number of plant crea-tures whose combined level or HD do not exceed twice your level. </p>

     <p>This spell allows you some degree of con-trol over an undead creature. Assuming the subject is intelligent, it perceives your words and actions in the most favorable way (treat its attitude as friendly). It will not attack you while the spell lasts. You can try to give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn’t ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) An intelligent commanded undead never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing (see charm person). A nonintelligent undead creature (such as a skeleton or zombie) gets no saving throw against this spell. When you control a mindless being, you can communicate only basic commands, such as “come here,” “go there,” “fight,” “stand still,” and so on. Nonintelligent undead won’t resist sui-cidal or obviously harmful orders. Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the commanded undead (regardless of its Intelligence) breaks the spell. Your commands are not telepathic. The undead creature must be able to hear you.</p>

     <p>You contact your deity—or agents thereof —and ask questions that can be answered by a simple yes or no. (A cleric of no particular deity contacts a philosophically allied deity.) You are allowed one such question per caster level. The answers given are correct within the limits of the entity’s knowledge. “Unclear” is a legitimate answer, because powerful beings of the Outer Planes are not neces-sarily omniscient. In cases where a one-word answer would be misleading or con-trary to the deity’s interests, the DM should give a short phrase (five words or less) as an answer instead. The spell, at best, provides information to aid character decisions. The entities contacted structure their answers to fur-ther their own purposes. If you lag, discuss the answers, or go off to do anything else, the spell ends.</p>

     <p>You become one with nature, attaining knowledge of the surrounding territory. You instantly gain knowledge of as many as three facts from among the following subjects: the ground or terrain, plants, minerals, bodies of water, people, general animal population, presence of woodland creatures, presence of powerful unnatural creatures, or even the general state of the natural setting. For example, you could determine the location of any powerful undead creatures, the location of all major sources of safe drinking water, and the location of any buildings (which register as blind spots). In outdoor settings, the spell operates in a radius of 1 mile per caster level. In natural underground settings—caves, caverns, and the like—the radius is limited to 100 feet per caster level. The spell does not function where nature has been replaced by construction or settlement, such as in dungeons and towns. </p>

     <p>You can understand the spoken words of creatures or read otherwise incomprehen-sible written messages. In either case, you must touch the creature or the writing. The ability to read does not necessarily impart insight into the material, merely its literal meaning. The spell enables you to understand or read an unknown language, not speak or write it. Written material can be read at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute. Magical writing cannot be read, though the spell reveals that it is magical, but comprehend languages is often useful when deciphering treasure maps. This spell can be foiled by certain warding magic (such as the secret page and illusory script spells). It does not decipher codes or reveal messages concealed in otherwise normal text. Comprehend languages can be made per-manent with a permanency spell. </p>

     <p>This spell causes the targets to become confused, making them unable to inde-pendently determine what they will do. Roll on the following table at the begin-ning of each subject’s turn each round to see what the subject does in that round. d% Behavior 01–10 Attack caster with melee or ranged weapons (or close with caster if attack is not possible). 11–20 Act normally. 21–50 Do nothing but babble incoherently. 51–70 Flee away from caster at top possible speed. 71–100 Attack nearest creature (for this purpose, a familiar counts as part of the subject’s self). A confused character who can’t carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently. Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking a confused character. Any confused character who is attacked automatically attacks its attackers on its next turn, as long as it is still confused when its turn comes. Note that a confused character will not make attacks of opportunity against any creature that it is not already devoted to attacking (either because of its most recent action or because it has just been attacked). </p>

     <p>This spell blesses an area with positive energy. Each Charisma check made to turn undead within this area gains a +3 sacred bonus. Every undead creature entering a consecrated area suffers minor disruption, giving it a –1 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saves. Undead cannot be created within or summoned into a consecrated area. If the consecrated area contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture dedi-cated to your deity, pantheon, or aligned higher power, the modifiers given above are doubled (+6 sacred bonus on turning checks, –2 penalties for undead in the area). You cannot consecrate an area with a similar fixture of a deity other than your own patron. If the area does contain an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture of a deity, pan-theon, or higher power other than your patron, the consecrate spell instead curses the area, cutting off its connection with the associated deity or power. This sec-ondary function, if used, does not also grant the bonuses and penalties relating to undead, as given above. Consecrate counters and dispels desecrate.</p>
     <p>Material Component: A vial of holy water and 25 gp worth (5 pounds) of silver dust, all of which must be sprinkled around the area. </p>

     <p>You send your mind to another plane of existence (an Elemental Plane or some plane farther removed) in order to receive advice and information from powers there. (See the accompanying table for possible consequences and results of the attempt.) The powers reply in a language you understand, but they resent such contact and give only brief answers to your questions. (The DM answers all questions with “yes,” “no,” “maybe,” “never,” “irrele-vant,” or some other one-word answer.) You must concentrate on maintaining the spell (a standard action) in order to ask questions at the rate of one per round. A question is answered by the power during the same round. For every two caster levels, you may ask one question. Contact with minds far removed from your home plane increases the probability that you will incur a decrease to Intelligence and Charisma, but the chance of the power knowing the answer, as well as the probability of the entity answering correctly, are likewise increased by moving to distant planes. Once the Outer Planes are reached, the power of the deity contacted determines the effects. (Random results obtained from the table are subject to DM changes, the personalities of indivi-dual deities, and so on.) On rare occasions, this divination may be blocked by an act of certain deities or forces. </p>

     <p>discharged You can place another spell upon your person so that it comes into effect under some condition you dictate when casting contingency. The contingency spell and the companion spell are cast at the same time. The 10-minute casting time is the mini-mum total for both castings; if the com-panion spell has a casting time longer than 10 minutes, use that instead. The spell to be brought into effect by the contingency must be one that affects your person (feather fall, levitate, fly, teleport, and so forth) and be of a spell level no higher than one-third your caster level (rounded down, maximum 6th level). The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general. For example, a contingency cast with water breathing might prescribe that any time you are plunged into or otherwise engulfed in water or similar liquid, the water breathing spell instantly comes into effect. Or a contingency could bring a feather fall spell into effect any time you fall more than 4 feet. In all cases, the contingency immediately brings into effect the companion spell, the latter being “cast” instantaneously when the prescribed cir-cumstances occur. If complicated or con-voluted conditions are prescribed, the whole spell combination (contingency and the companion magic) may fail when called on. The companion spell occurs based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether you want it to. You can use only one contingency spell at a time; if a second is cast, the first one (if still active) is dispelled.</p>
     <p>Material Component: That of the com-panion spell, plus quicksilver and an eye-lash of an ogre mage, rakshasa, or similar spell-using creature.</p>

     <p>Depending on the version you choose, the control water spell raises or lowers water. Lower Water: This causes water or similar liquid to reduce its depth by as much as 2 feet per caster level (to a minimum depth of 1 inch). The water is lowered within a squarish depression whose sides are up to caster level × 10 feet long. In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as a deep ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell. When cast on water elementals and other water-based creatures, this spell acts as a slow spell (Will negates). The spell has no effect on other creatures. Raise Water: This causes water or similar liquid to rise in height, just as the lower water version causes it to lower. Boats raised in this way slide down the sides of the hump that the spell creates. If the area affected by the spell includes riverbanks, a beach, or other land nearby, the water can spill over onto dry land. With either version, you may reduce one horizontal dimension by half and double the other horizontal dimension. </p>
     <p>Arcane Material Component: A drop of water (for raise water) or a pinch of dust (for lower water). </p>

     <p>You change the weather in the local area. It takes 10 minutes to cast the spell and an additional 10 minutes for the effects to manifest. The current, natural weather conditions are determined by the DM. You can call forth weather appropriate to the climate and season of the area you are in. Season Possible Weather Spring Tornado, thunderstorm, sleet storm, or hot weather Summer Torrential rain, heat wave, or hailstorm Autumn Hot or cold weather, fog, or sleet Winter Frigid cold, blizzard, or thaw Late winter Hurricane-force winds or early spring (coastal area) You control the general tendencies of the weather, such as the direction and inten-sity of the wind. You cannot control spe-cific applications of the weather—where lightning strikes, for example, or the exact path of a tornado. When you select a certain weather condition to occur, the weather assumes that condition 10 min-utes later (changing gradually, not abruptly). The weather continues as you left it for the duration, or until you use a standard action to designate a new kind of weather (which fully manifests itself 10 minutes later). Contradictory conditions are not possible simultaneously—fog and strong wind, for example. Control weather can do away with atmospheric phenomena (naturally oc-curring or otherwise) as well as create them. A druid casting this spell doubles the duration and affects a circle with a 3-mile radius. </p>

     <p>You alter wind force in the area surround-ing you. You can make the wind blow in a certain direction or manner, increase its strength, or decrease its strength. The new wind direction and strength persist until the spell ends or until you choose to alter your handiwork, which requires con-centration. You may create an “eye” of calm air up to 80 feet in diameter at the center of the area if you so desire, and you may choose to limit the area to any cylindrical area less than your full limit (for example, a 20-foot-diameter tornado centered 100 feet away). Wind Direction: You may choose one of four basic wind patterns to function over the spell’s area. A downdraft blows from the center outward in equal strength in all direc-tions. An updraft blows from the outer edges in toward the center in equal strength from all directions, veering upward before impinging on the eye in the center. A rotation causes the winds to circle the center in clockwise or counter-clockwise fashion. A blast simply causes the winds to blow in one direction across the entire area from one side to the other. Wind Strength: For every three caster levels, you can increase or decrease wind strength by one level. (The categories of wind strength are briefly described below, with more detail to be found in the Dun-geon Master’s Guide.) Each round on your turn, a creature in the wind must make a Fortitude save or suffer the effect of being in the windy area. Strong winds (21+ mph) make sailing difficult. A severe wind (31+ mph) causes minor ship and building damage. A windstorm (51+ mph) drives most flying creatures from the skies, uproots small trees, knocks down light wooden structures, tears off roofs, and endangers ships. Hurricane force winds (75+ mph) de-stroy wooden buildings, sometimes uproot even large trees, and cause most ships to founder. A tornado (175+ mph) destroys all non-fortified buildings and often uproots large trees. </p>

     <p>A much more potent spell than animate dead, this evil spell allows you to create more powerful sorts of undead: ghouls, ghasts, mummies, and mohrgs (see the Monster Manual for more information on all types of undead). The type or types of undead you can create is based on your caster level, as shown on the table below. Caster Level Undead Created 11th or lower Ghoul 12th–14th Ghast 15th–17th Mummy 18th or higher Mohrg You may create less powerful undead than your level would allow if you choose. For example, at 16th level you could decide to create a ghoul or a ghast instead of a mummy. Doing this may be a good idea, because created undead are not automati-cally under the control of their animator. If you are capable of commanding undead, you may attempt to command the undead creature as it forms (see Turn or Rebuke Undead, page 159). This spell must be cast at night.</p>
     <p>Material Component: A clay pot filled with grave dirt and another filled with brackish water. The spell must be cast on a dead body. You must place a black onyx gem worth at least 50 gp per HD of the undead to be created into the mouth or eye socket of each corpse. The magic of the spell turns these gems into worthless shells. </p>

Water can be created in an area as small as will actually contain the liquid, or in an area three times as large—possibly creating a downpour or filling many small recep-tacles. Note: Conjuration spells can’t create substances or objects within a creature. Water weighs about 8 pounds per gallon. One cubic foot of water contains roughly 8 gallons and weighs about 60 pounds. </p>

(See the Monster Manual for details on centipede swarms.) You may summon the centipede swarms so that they share the area of other crea-tures. The swarms remain stationary, attacking any creatures in their area, unless you command the creeping doom to move (a standard action). As a standard action, you can command any number of the swarms to move toward any prey within 100 feet of you. You cannot command any swarm to move more than 100 feet away from you, and if you move more than 100 feet from any swarm, that swarm remains stationary, attacking any creatures in its area (but it can be commanded again if you move within 100 feet). </p>

     <p>This spell causes an object to radiate shadowy illumination out to a 20-foot radius. All creatures in the area gain con-cealment (20% miss chance). Even crea-tures that can normally see in such con-ditions (such as with darkvision or low-light vision) have the miss chance in an area shrouded in magical darkness. Normal lights (torches, candles, lanterns, and so forth) are incapable of brightening the area, as are light spells of lower level (such as light or dancing lights). Higher level light spells (such as daylight) are not affected by darkness. If darkness is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under a lightproof covering, the spell’s effect is blocked until the covering is removed.

     <p>The object touched sheds light as bright as full daylight in a 60-foot radius, and dim light for an additional 60 feet beyond that. Creatures that take penalties in bright light also take them while within the radius of this magical light. Despite its name, this spell is not the equivalent of daylight for the purposes of creatures that are damaged or destroyed by bright light (such as vampires). If daylight is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under a light-proof covering, the spell’s effects are blocked until the covering is removed. Daylight brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa) is temporarily negated, so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect. Daylight counters or dispels any dark-ness spell of equal or lower level, such as darkness. </p>

If the subject fails its saving throw, it dies, and you gain 1d8 temporary hit points and a +2 bonus to Strength. Additionally, your effective caster level goes up by +1, improving spell effects dependent on caster level. (This increase in effective caster level does not grant you access to more spells.)

     <p><sup><strong>Продолжительность:</strong> 5 rounds or less; see text </sup></p>
     <p>This spell functions like fireball, except that it is more powerful and can detonate up to 5 rounds after the spell is cast. The burst of flame deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 20d6). The glowing bead created by delayed blast fireball can detonate immediately if you desire, or you can choose to delay the burst for as many as 5 rounds. You select the amount of delay upon completing the spell, and that time cannot change once it has been set unless someone touches the bead (see below). If you choose a delay, the glowing bead sits at its destination until it detonates. A creature can pick up and hurl the bead as a thrown weapon (range increment 10 feet). If a creature handles and moves the bead within 1 round of its detonation, there is a 25% chance that the bead detonates while being handled. </p>

     <p>This spell imbues an area with negative energy. Each Charisma check made to turn undead within this area takes a –3 profane penalty, and every undead creature entering a desecrated area gains a +1 profane bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws. An undead creature created within or summoned into such an area gains +1 hit points per HD. If the desecrated area contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture dedi-cated to your deity or aligned higher power, the modifiers given above are dou-bled (–6 profane penalty on turning checks, +2 profane bonus and +2 hit points per HD for undead in the area). Further-more, anyone who casts animate dead within this area may create as many as double the normal amount of undead (that is, 4 HD per caster level rather than 2 HD per caster level). If the area contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture of a deity, pan-theon, or higher power other than your patron, the desecrate spell instead curses the area, cutting off its connection with the associated deity or power. This secondary function, if used, does not also grant the bonuses and penalties relating to undead, as given above. Desecrate counters and dispels consecrate.</p>

     <p>You can detect a particular kind of animal or plant in a cone emanating out from you in whatever direction you face. You must think of a kind of animal or plant when using the spell, but you can change the animal or plant kind each round. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you search a particular area or focus on a specific kind of animal or plant. 1st Round: Presence or absence of that kind of animal or plant in the area. 2nd Round: Number of individuals of the specified kind in the area, and the condition of the healthiest specimen. 3rd Round: The condition (see below) and location of each individual present. If an animal or plant is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location. Conditions: For purposes of this spell, the categories of condition are as follows: Normal: Has at least 90% of full normal hit points, free of disease. Fair: 30% to 90% of full normal hit points remaining. Poor: Less than 30% of full normal hit points remaining, afflicted with a disease, or suffering from a debilitating injury. Weak: 0 or fewer hit points remaining, afflicted with a disease in the terminal stage, or crippled. If a creature falls into more than one category, the spell indicates the weaker of the two. Each round you can turn to detect a kind of animal or plant in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it. The DM decides if a specific kind of animal or plant is present. </p>

     <p>You can sense the presence of evil. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject. 1st Round: Presence or absence of evil. 2nd Round: Number of evil auras (crea-tures, objects, or spells) in the area and the power of the most potent evil aura present. If you are of good alignment, and the strongest evil aura’s power is overwhelm-ing (see below), and the HD or level of the aura’s source is at least twice your character level, you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends. 3rd Round: The power and location of each aura. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location. Aura Power: An evil aura’s power de-pends on the type of evil creature or object that you’re detecting and its HD, caster level, or (in the case of a cleric) class level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one strength category, the spell indicates the stronger of the two. For example, as indicated on the table, an evil outsider with 12 HD has an over-whelming aura of evil. A good cleric who casts this spell and directs it at the location of such a creature for longer than 1 round loses the spell and is stunned for 1 round if his character level is 6th or lower. Lingering Aura: An evil aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a creature or magic item). If detect evil is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power: Duration of Original Strength Lingering Aura Faint 1d6 rounds Moderate 1d6 minutes Strong 1d6×10 minutes Overwhelming 1d6 days Animals, traps, poisons, and other poten-tial perils are not evil, and as such this spell does not detect them. Each round, you can turn to detect evil in a new area. The spell can penetrate bar-riers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it. </p>

     <p>You detect magical auras. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject. 1st Round: Presence or absence of magi-cal auras. 2nd Round: Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura. 3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + half caster level for a nonspell effect.) Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras. Aura Strength: An aura’s power depends on a spell’s functioning spell level or an item’s caster level. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two. Lingering Aura: A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). If detect magic is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indi-cates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura).

     <p>You can detect secret doors, compart-ments, caches, and so forth. Only passages, doors, or openings that have been spec-ifically constructed to escape detection are detected by this spell—an ordinary trapdoor underneath a pile of crates would not be detected. The amount of infor-mation revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject. 1st Round: Presence or absence of secret doors. 2nd Round: Number of secret doors and the location of each. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location. Each Additional Round: The mechanism or trigger for one particular secret portal closely examined by you. Each round, you can turn to detect secret doors in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it. </p>

     <p>You can detect simple pits, deadfalls, and snares as well as mechanical traps con-structed of natural materials. The spell does not detect complex traps, including trapdoor traps. Detect snares and pits does detect certain natural hazards—quicksand (a snare), a sinkhole (a pit), or unsafe walls of natural rock (a deadfall). However, it does not reveal other potentially dangerous condi-tions, such as a cavern that floods during rain, an unsafe construction, or a naturally poisonous plant. The spell does not detect magic traps (except those that operate by pit, deadfall, or snaring; see the spell snare), nor mechanically complex ones, nor those that have been rendered safe or inactive. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particu-lar area. 1st Round: Presence or absence of hazards. 2nd Round: Number of hazards and the location of each. If a hazard is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location. Each Additional Round: The general type and trigger for one particular hazard closely examined by you. Each round, you can turn to detect snares and pits in a new area.

     <p>You detect surface thoughts. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject. 1st Round: Presence or absence of thoughts (from conscious creatures with Intelligence scores of 1 or higher). 2nd Round: Number of thinking minds and the Intelligence score of each. If the highest Intelligence is 26 or higher (and at least 10 points higher than your own Intelligence score), you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends. This spell does not let you determine the location of the thinking minds if you can’t see the crea-tures whose thoughts you are detecting. 3rd Round: Surface thoughts of any mind in the area. A target’s Will save prevents you from reading its thoughts, and you must cast detect thoughts again to have another chance. Creatures of animal intel-ligence (Int 1 or 2) have simple, instinctual thoughts that you can pick up. Each round, you can turn to detect thoughts in a new area.

     <p>You can detect the aura that surrounds undead creatures. The amount of informa-tion revealed depends on how long you study a particular area. 1st Round: Presence or absence of undead auras. 2nd Round: Number of undead auras in the area and the strength of the strongest undead aura present. If you are of good alignment, and the strongest undead aura’s strength is overwhelming (see below), and the creature has HD of at least twice your character level, you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends. 3rd Round: The strength and location of each undead aura. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location. Aura Strength: The strength of an undead aura is determined by the HD of the undead creature, as given on the following table: HD Strength 1 or lower Faint 2–4 Moderate 5–10 Strong 11 or higher Overwhelming Lingering Aura: An undead aura lingers after its original source is destroyed. If detect undead is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power: Duration of Original Strength Lingering Aura Faint 1d6 rounds Moderate 1d6 minutes Strong 1d6×10 minutes Overwhelming 1d6 days Each round, you can turn to detect undead in a new area.

No saving throw is allowed against these effects. Deafened: The creature is deafened for 1d4 rounds. Slowed: The creature is slowed, as by the slow spell, for 2d4 rounds. Paralyzed: The creature is paralyzed and helpless for 1d10 minutes. Killed: Living creatures die. Undead creatures are destroyed. Furthermore, if you are on your home plane when you cast this spell, nonlawful extraplanar creatures within the area are instantly banished back to their home planes. Creatures so banished cannot return for at least 24 hours. This effect takes place regardless of whether the crea-tures hear the dictum. The banishment effect allows a Will save (at a –4 penalty) to negate. Creatures whose HD exceed your caster level are unaffected by dictum. </p>

     <p>You instantly transfer yourself from your current location to any other spot within range. You always arrive at exactly the spot desired—whether by simply visualizing the area or by stating direction, such as “900 feet straight downward,” or “upward to the northwest, 45-degree angle, 1,200 feet.” After using this spell, you can’t take any other actions until your next turn. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn’t exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maxi-mum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. If you arrive in a place that is already occupied by a solid body, you and each creature traveling with you take 1d6 points of damage and are shunted to a random open space on a suitable surface within 100 feet of the intended location. If there is no free space within 100 feet, you and each creature traveling with you take an additional 2d6 points of damage and are shunted to a free space within 1,000 feet. If there is no free space within 1,000 feet, you and each creature travelling with you take an additional 4d6 points of damage and the spell simply fails. </p>

     <p>A green ray springs from your out-stretched hand. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit the target. Any creature or object struck by the ray is covered with a shimmering emerald field that com-pletely blocks extradimensional travel. Forms of movement barred by a dimen-sional anchor include astral projection, blink, dimension door, ethereal jaunt, etherealness, gate, maze, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and similar spell-like or psionic abilities. The spell also prevents the use of a gate or teleportation circle for the duration of the spell. A dimensional anchor does not interfere with the movement of creatures already in ethereal or astral form when the spell is cast, nor does it block extradimensional perception or attack forms, such as a basilisk’s gaze.

     <p>This spell has two versions. </p>
     <p>Prune Growth: This version causes nor-mal vegetation (grasses, briars, bushes, creepers, hedges, thistles, trees, vines, and so forth) within long range (400 feet + 40 feet per level) to shrink to about one-third of their normal size, becoming untangled and less bushy. The affected vegetation appears to have been carefully pruned and trimmed. At your option, the area can be a 100- foot-radius circle, a 150-foot-radius semi-circle, or a 200-foot-radius quarter-circle. You may also designate portions of the area that are not affected. </p>
     <p>Stunt Growth: This version targets nor-mal plants within a range of 1/2 mile, reducing their potential productivity over the course of the following year to one-third below normal. Diminish plants counters plant growth. This spell has no effect on plant crea-tures. </p>

     <p>A discern location spell is among the most powerful means of locating creatures or objects. Nothing short of a mind blank spell or the direct intervention of a deity keeps you from learning the exact location of a single individual or object. Discern location circumvents normal means of protection from scrying or location. The spell reveals the name of the creature or object’s location (place, name, business name, building name, or the like), community, county (or similar political division), country, continent, and the plane of existence where the target lies. To find a creature with the spell, you must have seen the creature or have some item that once belonged to it. To find an object, you must have touched it at least once. </p>

     <p>You make yourself—including clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment—look different. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller, thin, fat, or in between. You cannot change your body type. For example, a hu-man caster could look human, humanoid, or like any other human-shaped bipedal creature. Otherwise, the extent of the apparent change is up to you. You could add or obscure a minor feature or look like an entirely different person. The spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form, nor does it alter the perceived tactile (touch) or audible (sound) properties of you or your equipment. A battleaxe made to look like a dagger still functions as a battleaxe. If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on the Disguise check. A creature that interacts with the glamer gets a Will save to recognize it as an illusion. For example, a creature that touched you and realized that the tactile sensation did not match the visual one would be entitled to such a save. </p>

     <p>A thin, green ray springs from your point-ing finger. You must make a successful ranged touch attack to hit. Any creature struck by the ray takes 2d6 points of damage per caster level (to a maximum of 40d6). Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this spell is entirely disinte-grated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. A disintegrated creature’s equipment is unaffected. When used against an object, the ray simply disintegrates as much as one 10- foot cube of nonliving matter. Thus, the spell disintegrates only part of any very large object or structure targeted. The ray affects even objects constructed entirely of force, such as Bigby’s forceful hand or a wall of force, but not magical effects such as a globe of invulnerability or an antimagic field. A creature or object that makes a suc-cessful Fortitude save is partially affected, taking only 5d6 points of damage. If this damage reduces the creature or object to 0 or fewer hit points, it is entirely disinte-grated. Only the first creature or object struck can be affected; that is, the ray affects only one target per casting. </p>

Second, on making a successful melee touch attack against an evil creature from another plane, you can choose to drive that creature back to its home plane. The creature can negate the effects with a suc-cessful Will save (spell resistance applies). This use discharges and ends the spell. Third, with a touch you can automati-cally dispel any one enchantment spell cast by an evil creature or any one evil spell. Exception: Spells that can’t be dis-pelled by dispel magic also can’t be dispelled by dispel evil. Saving throws and spell resistance do not apply to this effect. This use discharges and ends the spell. </p>

     <p>Because magic is so powerful, so too is the ability to dispel magic. You can use dispel magic to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster’s spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can’t be defeated by dispel magic. Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. Note: The effect of a spell with an in-stantaneous duration can’t be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect. Thus, you can’t use dispel magic to repair damage caused by a fireball or to turn a petrified character back to flesh. In these cases, the magic has departed, leaving only burned flesh or perfectly normal stone in its wake. You choose to use dispel magic in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell: Targeted Dispel: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell’s caster level. For example, Mialee, at 5th level, targets dispel magic on a drow who is under the effects of haste, mage armor, and bull’s strength. All three spells were cast on the drow by a 7th-level wizard. Mialee makes a dispel check (1d20 + 5 against DC 18) three times, once each for the haste, mage armor, and bull’s strength effects. If she succeeds on a particular check, that spell is dispelled (the drow’s spell resistance doesn’t help him); if she fails, that spell remains in effect. If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summon-ing), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature. If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item’s caster level. If you succeed, all the item’s magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item’s physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this. You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself. Area Dispel: When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot radius. For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the dispel magic spell so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature’s magic items are not affected. For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel. For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the dispel magic spell, you can make a dispel check to dispel the spell. For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the dispel magic spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area. If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object. You may choose to automatically suc-ceed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast. </p>
     <p>Counterspell: When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell (page 170). Unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel magic may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster’s spell. </p>

     <p>Similar to augury but more powerful, a divination spell can provide you with a useful piece of advice in reply to a question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity that is to occur within one week. The advice can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryp-tic rhyme or omen. For example, suppose the question is “Will we do well if we venture into the ruined temple of Erythnul?” The DM knows that a terrible troll guarding 10,000 gp and a +1 shield lurks near the entrance but estimates that your party could beat the troll after a hard fight. Therefore the divination response might be: “Ready oil and open flame light your way to wealth.” In all cases, the DM controls what infor-mation you receive. If your party doesn’t act on the information, the conditions may change so that the information is no longer useful. (For example, the troll could move away and take the treasure with it.) The base chance for a correct divination is 70% + 1% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%. The DM adjusts the chance if unusual circumstances require it (if, for example, unusual precautions against divination spells have been taken). If the dice roll fails, you know the spell failed, unless specific magic yielding false infor-mation is at work. As with augury, multiple divinations about the same topic by the same caster use the same dice result as the first divination spell and yield the same answer each time.</p>
     <p>Material Component: Incense and a sac-rificial offering appropriate to your reli-gion, together worth at least 25 gp. </p>

     <p>You can enchant an animal and direct it with simple commands such as “Attack,” “Run,” and “Fetch.” Suicidal or self-de-structive commands (including an order to attack a creature two or more size cate-gories larger than the dominated animal) are simply ignored. Dominate animal establishes a mental link between you and the subject creature. The animal can be directed by silent mental command as long as it remains in range. You need not see the creature to control it. You do not receive direct sen-sory input from the creature, but you know what it is experiencing. Because you are directing the animal with your own intelligence, it may be able to undertake actions normally beyond its own com-prehension. You need not concentrate exclusively on controlling the creature unless you are trying to direct it to do something it normally couldn’t do. Changing your instructions or giving a dominated creature a new command is the equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action. </p>

     <p>You can control the actions of any hu-manoid creature through a telepathic link that you establish with the subject’s mind. If you and the subject have a common language, you can generally force the sub-ject to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities. If no common lan-guage exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as “Come here,” “Go there,” “Fight,” and “Stand still.” You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically. Once you have given a dominated crea-ture a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth). Because of this limited range of activity, a Sense Motive check against DC 15 (rather than DC 25) can determine that the subject’s behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (see the Sense Motive skill des-cription, page 81). Changing your instructions or giving a dominated creature a new command is the equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action. By concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action), you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject, though it still can’t communicate with you. You can’t actually see through the subject’s eyes, so it’s not as good as being there yourself, but you still get a good idea of what’s going on (the subject is walking through a smelly courtyard, the subject is talking to a guard, the guard looks suspicious, and so forth). Subjects resist this control, and any subject forced to take actions against its nature receives a new saving throw with a +2 bonus. Obviously self-destructive or-ders are not carried out. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane. You need not see the subject to control it. If you don’t spend at least 1 round con-centrating on the spell each day, the sub-ject receives a new saving throw to throw off the domination. Protection from evil or a similar spell can prevent you from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but such an effect neither prevents the establishment of domination nor dispels it. </p>

     <p>You, or a messenger touched by you, sends a phantasmal message to others in the form of a dream. At the beginning of the spell, you must name the recipient or identify him or her by some title that leaves no doubt as to identity. The mes-senger then enters a trance, appears in the intended recipient’s dream, and delivers the message. The message can be of any length, and the recipient remembers it perfectly upon waking. The communi-cation is one-way. The recipient cannot ask questions or offer information, nor can the messenger gain any information by observing the dreams of the recipient. Once the message is delivered, the mes-senger’s mind returns instantly to its body. The duration of the spell is the time required for the messenger to enter the recipient’s dream and deliver the message. If the recipient is awake when the spell begins, the messenger can choose to wake up (ending the spell) or remain in the trance. The messenger can remain in the trance until the recipient goes to sleep, then enter the recipient’s dream and de-liver the message as normal. A messenger that is disturbed during the trance comes awake, ending the spell. Creatures who don’t sleep (such as elves, but not half-elves) or don’t dream cannot be contacted by this spell. The messenger is unaware of its own surroundings or of the activities around it while in the trance. It is defenseless both physically and mentally (always fails any saving throw) while in the trance. </p>

     <p>When you cast earthquake, an intense but highly localized tremor rips the ground. The shock knocks creatures down, col-lapses structures, opens cracks in the ground, and more. The effect lasts for 1 round, during which time creatures on the ground can’t move or attack. A spellcaster on the ground must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries to cast. The earthquake affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area. The specific effect of an earthquake spell depends on the nature of the terrain where it is cast. Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel: The spell col-lapses the roof, dealing 8d6 points of blud-geoning damage to any creature caught under the cave-in (Reflex DC 15 half ) and pinning that creature beneath the rubble (see below). An earthquake cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris. Cliffs: Earthquake causes a cliff to crum-ble, creating a landslide that travels hori-zontally as far as it fell vertically. An earth-quake cast at the top of a 100-foot cliff would sweep debris 100 feet outward from the base of the cliff. Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below). Open Ground: Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down. Fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25% chance to fall into one (Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure). At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut, killing any creatures still trapped within. Structure: Any structure standing on open ground takes 100 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is (See the Dungeon Master’s Guide for information on hit points for walls and the like.) Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below). River, Lake, or Marsh: Fissures open underneath the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand. At the end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud. Pinned beneath Rubble: Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned. If a pinned character falls uncon-scious, he or she must make a DC 15 Constitution check or take 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead. </p>

     <p>This spell opens a portal to an Elemental Plane and summons elementals from it. A druid can choose the plane (Air, Earth, Fire, or Water); a cleric opens a portal to the plane matching his domain. When the spell is complete, 2d4 Large elementals appear. Ten minutes later, 1d4 Huge elementals appear. Ten minutes after that, one greater elemental appears. Each elemental has maximum hit points per HD. Once these creatures appear, they serve you for the duration of the spell. The elementals obey you explicitly and never attack you, even if someone else manages to gain control over them. You do not need to concentrate to maintain control over the elementals. You can dis-miss them singly or in groups at any time. When you use a summoning spell to summon an air, earth, fire, or water crea-ture, it is a spell of that type. For example, elemental swarm is a fire spell when you cast it to summon fire elementals and a water spell when you use it to summon water elementals. </p>

     <p>for enervation This spell functions like enervation, except that the creature struck gains 2d4 negative levels, and the negative levels last longer. There is no saving throw to avoid gain-ing the negative levels, but 24 hours after gaining them, the subject must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC = energy drain spell’s save DC) for each negative level. If the save succeeds, that negative level is removed. If it fails, the negative level also goes away, but one of the subject’s charac-ter levels is permanently drained. An undead creature struck by the ray gains 2d4×5 temporary hit points for 1 hour. </p>

     <p>You point your finger and utter the incan-tation, releasing a black ray of crackling negative energy that suppresses the life force of any living creature it strikes. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit. If the attack succeeds, the subject gains 1d4 negative levels. If the subject has at least as many nega-tive levels as HD, it dies. Each negative level gives a creature a –1 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, ability checks, and effective level (for deter-mining the power, duration, DC, and other details of spells or special abilities). Additionally, a spellcaster loses one spell or spell slot from his or her highest avail-able level. Negative levels stack. Assuming the subject survives, it re-gains lost levels after a number of hours equal to your caster level (maximum 15 hours). Usually, negative levels have a chance of permanently draining the victim’s levels, but the negative levels from enervation don’t last long enough to do so. An undead creature struck by the ray gains 1d4×5 temporary hit points for 1 hour. </p>

     <p>This spell causes instant growth of a hu-manoid creature, doubling its height and multiplying its weight by 8. This increase changes the creature’s size category to the next larger one. The target gains a +2 size bonus to Strength, a –2 size penalty to Dexterity (to a minimum of 1), and a –1 penalty on attack rolls and AC due to its increased size. A humanoid creature whose size in-creases to Large has a space of 10 feet and a natural reach of 10 feet. This spell does not change the target’s speed. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it—the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size. All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly enlarged by the spell. Melee and projectile weapons affected by this spell deal more damage (see Table 2–2 in the Dungeon Master’s Guide). Other mag-ical properties are not affected by this spell. Any enlarged item that leaves an enlarged creature’s possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage, and projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them. Magical properties of enlarged items are not increased by this spell—an enlarged +1 sword still has only a +1 enhancement bonus, a staff-sized wand is still only capable of its normal functions, a giant-sized potion merely requires a greater fluid intake to make its magical effects operate, and so on. Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack, which means (among other things) that you can’t use a second casting of this spell to further increase the size of a humanoid that’s still under the effect of the first casting. Enlarge person counters and dispels reduce person. Enlarge person can be made permanent with a permanency spell.</p>

The creature can break free and move half its normal speed by using a full-round action to make a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 20 Escape Artist check. A creature that succeeds on a Reflex save is not entangled but can still move at only half speed through the area.

     <p>If you have the attention of a group of creatures, you can use this spell to hold them spellbound. To cast the spell, you must speak or sing without interruption for 1 full round. Thereafter, those affected give you their undivided attention, ignor-ing their surroundings. They are consid-ered to have an attitude of friendly while under the effect of the spell (see the Dun-geon Master’s Guide for information about NPC attitudes). Any potentially affected creature of a race or religion unfriendly to yours gets a +4 bonus on the saving throw. A creature with 4 or more HD or with a Wisdom score of 16 or higher remains aware of its surroundings and has an atti-tude of indifferent. It gains a new saving throw if it witnesses actions that it opposes. The effect lasts as long as you speak or sing, to a maximum of 1 hour. Those enthralled by your words take no action while you speak or sing and for 1d3 rounds thereafter while they discuss the topic or performance. Those entering the area during the performance must also successfully save or become enthralled. The speech ends (but the 1d3-round delay still applies) if you lose concentration or do anything other than speak or sing. If those not enthralled have unfriendly or hostile attitudes toward you, they can collectively make a Charisma check to try to end the spell by jeering and heckling. For this check, use the Charisma bonus of the creature with the highest Charisma in the group; others may make Charisma checks to assist (as described in Aid Another, page 65). The heckling ends the spell if this check result beats your Charisma check result. Only one such challenge is allowed per use of the spell. If any member of the audience is at-tacked or subjected to some other overtly hostile act, the spell ends and the previ-ously enthralled members become imme-diately unfriendly toward you. Each crea-ture with 4 or more HD or with a Wisdom score of 16 or higher becomes hostile. </p>

With this spell, you can remove explosive runes, a glyph of warding, a sepia snake sigil, or an arcane mark, but not illusory script or a symbol spell. Nonmagical writing is automatically erased if you touch it and no one else is holding it. Otherwise, the chance of erasing nonmagical writing is 90%. Magic writing must be touched to be erased, and you also must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against DC 15. (A natural 1 or 2 is always a failure on this check.) If you fail to erase explosive runes, a glyph of warding, or a sepia snake sigil, you accidentally activate that writing instead. </p>

     <p>You become ethereal, along with your equipment. For the duration of the spell, you are in a place called the Ethereal Plane, which overlaps the normal, physical, Material Plane. When the spell expires, you return to material existence. An ethereal creature is invisible, insub-stantial, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down, albeit at half normal speed. As an insubstantial creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures. An ethereal creature can see and hear on the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and ephemeral. Sight and hearing onto the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet. Force effects (such as magic missile and wall of force) and abjurations affect an ethereal creature normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can’t attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane (such as a basilisk’s gaze attack). Treat other ethereal creatures and ethereal objects as if they were material. If you end the spell and become mate-rial while inside a material object (such as a solid wall), you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet that you so travel. </p>

     <p>This spell conjures a field of rubbery black tentacles, each 10 feet long. These waving members seem to spring forth from the earth, floor, or whatever surface is underfoot—including water. They grasp and entwine around creatures that enter the area, holding them fast and crushing them with great strength. Every creature within the area of the spell must make a grapple check, opposed by the grapple check of the tentacles. Treat the tentacles attacking a particular target as a Large creature with a base attack bonus equal to your caster level and a Strength score of 19. Thus, its grapple check modi-fier is equal to your caster level +8. The ten-tacles are immune to all types of damage. Once the tentacles grapple an opponent, they may make a grapple check each round on your turn to deal 1d6+4 points of bludgeoning damage. The tentacles continue to crush the opponent until the spell ends or the opponent escapes. Any creature that enters the area of the spell is immediately attacked by the ten-tacles. Even creatures who aren’t grappling with the tentacles may move through the area at only half normal speed.</p>

     <p>You trace these mystic runes upon a book, map, scroll, or similar object bearing writ-ten information. The runes detonate when read, dealing 6d6 points of force damage. Anyone next to the runes (close enough to read them) takes the full damage with no saving throw; any other creature within 10 feet of the runes is entitled to a Reflex save for half damage. The object on which the runes were written also takes full damage (no saving throw). You and any characters you specifically instruct can read the protected writing without triggering the runes. Likewise, you can remove the runes whenever desired. Another creature can remove them with a successful dispel magic or erase spell, but attempting to dispel or erase the runes and failing to do so triggers the explosion. Note: Magic traps such as explosive runes are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find the runes and Disable Device to thwart them. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 28 for explosive runes. </p>

     <p>Each round, you may target a single living creature, striking it with waves of evil power. Depending on the target’s HD, this attack has as many as three effects. HD Effect 10 or more Sickened 5–9 Panicked, sickened 4 or less Comatose, panicked, sickened The effects are cumulative and concurrent. Sickened: Sudden pain and fever sweeps over the subject’s body. A sickened crea-ture takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. A creature affected by this spell remains sickened for 10 minutes per caster level. The effects cannot be negated by a remove disease or heal spell, but a remove curse is effective. Panicked: The subject becomes panicked for 1d4 rounds. Even after the panic ends, the creature remains shaken for 10 minutes per caster level, and it automati-cally becomes panicked again if it comes within sight of you during that time. This is a fear effect. Comatose: The subject falls into a cata-tonic coma for 10 minutes per caster level. During this time, it cannot be awakened by any means short of dispelling the effect. This is not a sleep effect, and thus elves are not immune to it. The spell lasts for 1 round per three caster levels. You must spend a move action each round after the first to target a foe. </p>

     <p>You convert material of one sort into a product that is of the same material. Thus, you can fabricate a wooden bridge from a clump of tress, a rope from a patch of hemp, clothes from flax or wool, and so forth. Creatures or magic items cannot be created or transmuted by the fabricate spell. The quality of items made by this spell is commensurate with the quality of material used as the basis for the new fabrication. If you work with a mineral, the target is reduced to 1 cubic foot per level instead of 10 cubic feet. You must make an appropriate Craft check to fabricate articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship (jewelry, swords, glass, crystal, and the like). Casting requires 1 round per 10 cubic feet (or 1 cubic foot) of material to be affected by the spell.</p>

     <p>The affected creatures or objects fall slowly, though faster than feathers typi-cally do. Feather fall instantly changes the rate at which the targets fall to a mere 60 feet per round (equivalent to the end of a fall from a few feet), and the subjects take no damage upon landing while the spell is in effect. However, when the spell dura-tion expires, a normal rate of falling resu-mes. The spell affects one or more Medium or smaller creatures (including gear and carried objects up to each creature’s maxi-mum load) or objects, or the equivalent in larger creatures: A Large creature or object counts as two Medium creatures or objects, a Huge creature or object counts as two Large creatures or objects, and so forth. You can cast this spell with an instant utterance, quickly enough to save yourself if you unexpectedly fall. Casting the spell is a free action, like casting a quickened spell, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened spell per round. You may even cast this spell when it isn’t your turn. This spell has no special effect on ranged weapons unless they are falling quite a distance. If the spell is cast on a falling item, such as a boulder dropped from the top of a castle wall, the object does half normal damage based on its weight, with no bonus for the height of the drop. (See the Dungeon Master’s Guide for information on falling objects.) Feather fall works only upon free-falling objects. It does not affect a sword blow or a charging or flying creature. </p>

     <p>If the target creature fails a Will saving throw, its Intelligence and Charisma scores each drop to 1, giving it roughly the intellect of a lizard. The affected creature is unable to use Intelligence- or Charisma-based skills, cast spells, understand language, or communicate coherently. Still, it knows who its friends are and can follow them and even protect them. The subject remains in this state until a heal, limited wish, miracle, or wish spell is used to cancel the effect of the feeblemind.

     <p>The recipient of this spell can find the shortest, most direct physical route to a specified destination, be it the way into or out of a locale. The locale can be outdoors, underground, or even inside a maze spell. Find the path works with respect to lo-cations, not objects or creatures at a locale. Thus, the subject could not find the way to “a forest where a green dragon lives” or “a hoard of platinum pieces,” but it could find the exit to a labyrinth. The location must be on the same plane as you are at the time of casting. The spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction that will eventually lead it to its destination, indicating at ap-propriate times the exact path to follow or physical actions to take. For example, the spell enables the subject to sense trip wires or the proper word to bypass a glyph of warding. The spell ends when the desti-nation is reached or the duration expires, whichever comes first. Find the path can be used to remove the subject and its com-panions from the effect of a maze spell in a single round. This divination is keyed to the recipient, not its companions, and its effect does not predict or allow for the actions of creatures (including guardians).</p>

     <p>Depending on the version of fire seeds you choose, you turn acorns into splash weapons that you or another character can throw, or you turn holly berries into bombs that you can detonate on command. Acorn Grenades: As many as four acorns turn into special splash weapons that can be hurled as far as 100 feet. A ranged touch attack roll is required to strike the intended target. Together, the acorns are capable of dealing 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 20d6), divided up among the acorns as you wish. For example, a 20th-level druid could create one 20d6 missile, two 10d6 missiles, one 11d6 and three 3d6 missiles, or any other combination totalling up to four acorns and 20d6 points of damage. Each acorn explodes upon striking any hard surface. In addition to its regular fire damage, it deals 1 point of splash damage per die, and it ignites any combustible materials within 10 feet. A creature within this area that makes a successful Reflex saving throw takes only half damage; a creature struck directly is not allowed a saving throw. Holly Berry Bombs: You turn as many as eight holly berries into special bombs. The holly berries are usually placed by hand, since they are too light to make effective thrown weapons (they can be tossed only 5 feet). If you are within 200 feet and speak a word of command, each berry instantly bursts into flame, causing 1d8 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level to every creature in a 5-foot-radius burst and igniting any combustible materials within 5 feet. A creature in the area that makes a successful Reflex saving throw takes only half damage.</p>

     <p>This spell wreathes you in flame and causes damage to each creature that attacks you in melee. The flames also protect you from either cold-based or fire-based attacks (your choice). Any creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +15). This damage is either cold damage (if the shield protects against fire-based attacks) or fire damage (if the shield protects against cold-based attacks). If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies to this effect. Creatures wielding weapons with exceptional reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you. When casting this spell, you appear to immolate yourself, but the flames are thin and wispy, giving off light equal to only half the illumination of a normal torch (10 feet). The color of the flames is determined randomly (50% chance of either color)—blue or green if the chill shield is cast, violet or blue if the warm shield is employed. The special powers of each version are as follows. Warm Shield: The flames are warm to the touch. You take only half damage from cold-based attacks. If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save. Chill Shield: The flames are cool to the touch. You take only half damage from fire-based attacks. If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save. </p>

     <p>Fire trap creates a fiery explosion when an intruder opens the item that the trap pro-tects. A fire trap can ward any object that can be opened and closed (book, box, bottle, chest, coffer, coffin, door, drawer, and so forth). When casting fire trap, you select a point on the object as the spell’s center. When someone other than you opens the object, a fiery explosion fills the area within a 5-foot radius around the spell’s center. The flames deal 1d4 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +20). The item protected by the trap is not harmed by this explosion. A fire trapped item cannot have a second closure or warding spell placed on it. A knock spell does not bypass a fire trap. An unsuccessful dispel magic spell does not detonate the spell. Underwater, this ward deals half dam-age and creates a large cloud of steam. You can use the fire trapped object with-out discharging it, as can any individual to whom the object was specifically attuned when cast. Attuning a fire trapped object to an individual usually involves setting a password that you can share with friends. Note: Magic traps such as fire trap are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a fire trap and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level (DC 27 for a druid’s fire trap or DC 29 for the arcane version).</p>

     <p>A fireball spell is an explosion of flame that detonates with a low roar and deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to every creature within the area. Unattended objects also take this damage. The explosion creates almost no pressure. You point your finger and determine the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A glowing, pea-sized bead streaks from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball at that point. (An early impact results in an early detonation.) If you attempt to send the bead through a narrow passage, such as through an arrow slit, you must “hit” the opening with a ranged touch attack, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely. The fireball sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, and bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the fireball may continue beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.</p>

     <p>A 3-foot-long, blazing beam of red-hot fire springs forth from your hand. You wield this bladelike beam as if it were a scimitar. Attacks with the flame blade are melee touch attacks. The blade deals 1d8 points of fire damage +1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10). Since the blade is immaterial, your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage. A flame blade can ignite combustible materials such as parchment, straw, dry sticks, and cloth. The spell does not function underwater. </p>

     <p>A burning globe of fire rolls in whichever direction you point and burns those it strikes. It moves 30 feet per round. As part of this movement, it can ascend or jump up to 30 feet to strike a target. If it enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 2d6 points of fire damage to that creature, though a suc-cessful Reflex save negates that damage. A flaming sphere rolls over barriers less than 4 feet tall, such as furniture and low walls. It ignites flammable substances it touches and illuminates the same area as a torch would. The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest and burns. It can be extinguished by any means that would put out a normal fire of its size. The surface of the sphere has a spongy, yielding con-sistency and so does not cause damage except by its flame. It cannot push aside unwilling creatures or batter down large obstacles. A flaming sphere winks out if it exceeds the spell’s range. </p>

     <p>The subject can fly at a speed of 60 feet (or 40 feet if it wears medium or heavy armor, or if it carries a medium or heavy load). It can ascend at half speed and descend at double speed, and its maneuverability is good. Using a fly spell requires only as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or cast spells normally. The subject of a fly spell can charge but not run, and it cannot carry aloft more weight than its maximum load, plus any armor it wears. Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall. Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subject also descends in this way if the fly spell is dis-pelled, but not if it is negated by an antimagic field. </p>

     <p>A bank of fog billows out from the point you designate. The fog obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can’t use sight to locate the target). A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round. The spell does not function underwater. </p>

     <p>Forbiddance seals an area against all planar travel into or within it. This includes all teleportation spells (such as dimension door and teleport), plane shifting, astral travel, ethereal travel, and all summoning spells. Such effects simply fail automatically. In addition, it damages entering crea-tures whose alignments are different from yours. The effect on those attempting to enter the warded area is based on their alignment relative to yours (see below). A creature inside the area when the spell is cast takes no damage unless it exits the area and attempts to reenter, at which time it is affected as normal. Alignments identical: No effect. The crea-ture may enter the area freely (although not by planar travel). Alignments different with respect to either law/chaos or good/evil: The creature takes 6d6 points of damage. A successful Will save halves the damage, and spell resist-ance applies. Alignments different with respect to both law/chaos and good/evil: The creature takes 12d6 points of damage. A successful Will save halves the damage, and spell resist-ance applies. At your option, the abjuration can include a password, in which case crea-tures of alignments different from yours can avoid the damage by speaking the password as they enter the area. You must select this option (and the password) at the time of casting. Dispel magic does not dispel a forbiddance effect unless the dispeller’s level is at least as high as your caster level. You can’t have multiple overlapping for-biddance effects. In such a case, the more recent effect stops at the boundary of the older effect.</p>
     <p>Material Component: A sprinkling of holy water and rare incenses worth at least 1,500 gp, plus 1,500 gp per 60-foot cube. If a password is desired, this requires the burning of additional rare incenses worth at least 1,000 gp, plus 1,000 gp per 60-foot cube. </p>

     <p>This powerful spell brings into being an immobile, invisible cubical prison com-posed of either bars of force or solid walls of force (your choice). Creatures within the area are caught and contained unless they are too big to fit inside, in which case the spell automat-ically fails. Teleportation and other forms of astral travel provide a means of escape, but the force walls or bars extend into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel. Like a wall of force spell, a forcecage resists dispel magic, but it is vulnerable to a disinte-grate spell, and it can be destroyed by a sphere of annihilation or a rod of cancellation. Barred Cage: This version of the spell produces a 20-foot cube made of bands of force (similar to a wall of force spell) for bars. The bands are a half-inch wide, with half-inch gaps between them. Any creature capable of passing through such a small space can escape; others are confined. You can’t attack a creature in a barred cage with a weapon unless the weapon can fit between the gaps. Even against such weapons (including arrows and similar ranged attacks), a creature in the barred cage has cover. All spells and breath weapons can pass through the gaps in the bars. Windowless Cell: This version of the spell produces a 10-foot cube with no way in and no way out. Solid walls of force form its six sides.</p>

     <p>This spell grants you a powerful sixth sense in relation to yourself or another. Once foresight is cast, you receive instan-taneous warnings of impending danger or harm to the subject of the spell. Thus, if you are the subject of the spell, you would be warned in advance if a rogue were about to attempt a sneak attack on you, or if a creature were about to leap out from a hiding place, or if an attacker were specifically targeting you with a spell or ranged weapon. You are never surprised or flat-footed. In addition, the spell gives you a general idea of what action you might take to best protect yourself—duck, jump right, close your eyes, and so on—and gives you a +2 insight bonus to AC and Reflex saves. This insight bonus is lost whenever you would lose a Dexterity bonus to AC. When another creature is the subject of the spell, you receive warnings about that creature. You must communicate what you learn to the other creature for the warning to be useful, and the creature can be caught unprepared in the absence of such a warning. Shouting a warning, yanking a person back, and even telepathically communicating (via an appropriate spell) can all be accomplished before some danger befalls the subject, provided you act on the warning without delay. The subject, however, does not gain the insight bonus to AC and Reflex saves. </p>

The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Intelligence, adding the usual benefits to Intelligence-based skill checks and other uses of the Intelligence modifier. Wizards (and other spellcasters who rely on Intelligence) affected by this spell do not gain any additional bonus spells for the increased Intelligence, but the save DCs for spells they cast while under this spell’s effect do increase.

The subject automatically suc-ceeds on any grapple check made to resist a grapple attempt, as well as on grapple checks or Escape Artist checks made to escape a grapple or a pin. The spell also allows the subject to move and attack normally while underwater, even with slashing weapons such as axes and swords or with bludgeoning weapons such as flails, hammers, and maces, provided that the weapon is wielded in the hand rather than hurled.

     <p>The subject and all its gear become in-substantial, misty, and translucent. Its material armor (including natural armor) becomes worthless, though its size, Dex-terity, deflection bonuses, and armor bonuses from force effects (for example, from the mage armor spell) still apply. The subject gains damage reduction 10/magic and becomes immune to poison and criti-cal hits. It can’t attack or cast spells with verbal, somatic, material, or focus compo-nents while in gaseous form. (This does not rule out the use of certain spells that the subject may have prepared using the feats Silent Spell, Still Spell, and Eschew Materials.) The subject also loses super-natural abilities while in gaseous form. If it has a touch spell ready to use, that spell is discharged harmlessly when the gaseous form spell takes effect. A gaseous creature can’t run, but it can fly at a speed of 10 feet (maneuverability perfect). It can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, with all it was wearing or holding in its hands, as long as the spell persists. The creature is subject to the effects of wind, and it can’t enter water or other liquid. It also can’t manipulate objects or activate items, even those carried along with its gaseous form. Continuously active items remain active, though in some cases their effects may be moot (such as those that supply armor or natural armor bonuses). </p>

     <p>Casting a gate spell has two effects. First, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction. Second, you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the gate. The gate itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster’s choice), oriented in the direction you des-ire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side. A gate has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the gate from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not. Planar Travel: As a mode of planar travel, a gate spell functions much like a plane shift spell, except that the gate opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a gate from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you—anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A gate cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel. You could position a gate in a hallway in order to absorb any attack or force coming at you by shunting it to another plane. Whether the denizens of that plane appreciate this tactic is, of course, another matter. You may hold the gate open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connec-tion is severed. Calling Creatures: The second effect of the gate spell is to call an extraplanar crea-ture to your aid (a calling effect). By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the gate to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the gate, although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a gate that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of the spell has an XP cost (see below). If you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual—for in-stance, a bearded devil or a ghaele elad-rin—you may call either a single creature (of any HD) or several creatures. You can call and control several creatures as long as their HD total does not exceed your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD do not exceed twice your caster level. A single creature with more HD than twice your caster level can’t be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time. A controlled creature can be com-manded to perform a service for you. Such services fall into two categories: immediate tasks and contractual service. Fighting for you in a single battle or taking any other actions that can be accomplished within 1 round per caster level counts as an immediate task; you need not make any agreement or pay any reward for the creature’s help. The creature departs at the end of the spell. If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the lesser planar ally spell for appropriate rewards. (Some creatures may want their payment in “livestock” rather than in coin, which could involve complications.) Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane. Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you. Note: When you use a calling spell such as gate to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type. For example, gate is a chaotic and evil spell when you cast it to call a demon. </p>
     <p>XP Cost: 1,000 XP (only for the calling creatures function). </p>

     <p>This spell functions similarly to lesser geas, except that it affects a creature of any HD and allows no saving throw. Instead of taking penalties to ability scores (as with lesser geas), the subject takes 3d6 points of damage each day it does not attempt to follow the geas/quest. Addi-tionally, each day it must make a Fortitude saving throw or become sickened. These effects end 24 hours after the creature attempts to resume the geas/ quest. A remove curse spell ends a geas/quest spell only if its caster level is at least two higher than your caster level. Break en-chantment does not end a geas/quest, but limited wish, miracle, and wish do. Bards, sorcerers, and wizards usually refer to this spell as geas, while clerics call the same spell quest. </p>

     <p>A lesser geas places a magical command on a creature to carry out some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by you. The creature must have 7 or fewer Hit Dice and be able to understand you. While a geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity. The geased creature must follow the given instructions until the geas is com-pleted, no matter how long it takes. If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot com-plete through his own actions (such as “Wait here” or “Defend this area against attack”), the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level. A clever recipient can subvert some in-structions: For example, if you order the recipient to protect you from all harm, it might place you in a nice, safe dungeon for the duration of the spell. If the subject is prevented from obeying the lesser geas for 24 hours, it takes a –2 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day, another –2 penalty accumulates, up to a total of –8. No ability score can be re-duced to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the lesser geas. A lesser geas (and all ability score penal-ties) can be ended by break enchantment, limited wish, remove curse, miracle, or wish. Dispel magic does not affect a lesser geas. </p>

     <p>Ghost sound allows you to create a volume of sound that rises, recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed place. You choose what type of sound ghost sound creates when casting it and cannot thereafter change the sound’s basic character. The volume of sound created depends on your level. You can produce as much noise as four normal humans per caster level (maximum twenty humans). Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be cre-ated. The noise a ghost sound spell produces can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise from sixteen humans, while a roaring dire tiger is equal to the noise from twenty humans. Ghost sound can enhance the effective-ness of a silent image spell. Ghost sound can be made permanent with a permanency spell.</p>

     <p>You turn three normal-sized centipedes, two normal-sized spiders, or a single normal-sized scorpion into larger forms. Only one type of vermin can be trans-muted (so a single casting cannot affect both a centipede and a spider), and all must be grown to the same size. The size to which the vermin can be grown depends on your level; see the table below. The Monster Manual has game statistics for centipedes, spiders, and scorpions, as well as other kinds of vermin. Any giant vermin created by this spell do not attempt to harm you, but your con-trol of such creatures is limited to simple commands (“Attack,” “Defend,” “Stop,” and so forth). Orders to attack a certain crea-ture when it appears or guard against a particular occurrence are too complex for the vermin to understand. Unless com-manded to do otherwise, the giant vermin attack whoever or whatever is near them. The DM can extend this spell’s effects to other kinds of insects, arachnids, or other vermin, such as ants, bees, beetles, praying mantises, and wasps, if he so chooses.

     <p>An immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere surrounds you and excludes all spell effects of 3rd level or lower. The area or effect of any such spells does not include the area of the lesser globe of invulnerability. Such spells fail to affect any target located within the globe. Excluded effects include spell-like abilities and spells or spell-like effects from items. However, any type of spell can be cast through or out of the magical globe. Spells of 4th level and higher are not affected by the globe, nor are spells already in effect when the globe is cast. The globe can be brought down by a targeted dispel magic spell, but not by an area dispel magic. You can leave and return to the globe without penalty. Note that spell effects are not disrupted unless their effects enter the globe, and even then they are merely suppressed, not dispelled. For example, creatures inside the globe would still see a mirror image created by a caster outside the globe. If that caster then entered the globe, the images would wink out, to reappear when the caster exited the globe. Likewise, a caster standing in the area of a light spell would still receive sufficient illumination for vision, even though that part of the light spell’s area that lies within the globe would not be luminous. If a given spell has more than one level depending on which character class is casting it, use the level appropriate to the caster to determine whether lesser globe of invulnerability stops it.</p>

     <p>This powerful inscription harms those who enter, pass, or open the warded area or object. A glyph of warding can guard a bridge or passage, ward a portal, trap a chest or box, and so on. You set the conditions of the ward. Typ-ically, any creature entering the warded area or opening the warded object without speaking a password (which you set when casting the spell) is subject to the magic it stores. Alternatively or in addition to a password trigger, glyphs can be set according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight) or creature type, subtype, or kind (such as aberration, drow, or red dragon). Glyphs can also be set with respect to good, evil, law, or chaos, or to pass those of your religion. They cannot be set according to class, Hit Dice, or level. Glyphs respond to invisible creatures normally but are not triggered by those who travel past them ethereally. Multiple glyphs cannot be cast on the same area. However, if a cabinet has three drawers, each can be separately warded. When casting the spell, you weave a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. A glyph can be placed to conform to any shape up to the limitations of your total square footage. When the spell is completed, the glyph and tracery become nearly invisible. Glyphs cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as physical or magical probing, though they can be dispelled. Mislead, poly-morph, and nondetection (and similar magi-cal effects) can fool a glyph, though non-magical disguises and the like can’t. Read magic allows you to identify a glyph of warding with a DC 13 Spellcraft check. Identifying the glyph does not discharge it and allows you to know the basic nature of the glyph (version, type of damage caused, what spell is stored). The DM may decide that the exact glyphs available to you depend on your deity. He or she might also make new glyphs avail-able according to the magical research rules in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Note: Magic traps such as glyph of warding are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find the glyph and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 28 for glyph of warding. Depending on the version selected, a glyph either blasts the intruder or activates a spell. Blast Glyph: A blast glyph deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to the intruder and to all within 5 feet of him or her. This damage is acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic (caster’s choice, made at time of casting). Each creature affected can attempt a Reflex save to take half damage. Spell resistance applies against this effect. Spell Glyph: You can store any harmful spell of 3rd level or lower that you know. All level-dependent features of the spell are based on your caster level at the time of casting the glyph. If the spell has a target, it targets the intruder. If the spell has an area or an amorphous effect (such as a cloud), the area or effect is centered on the intruder. If the spell summons creatures, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack. Saving throws and spell resistance operate as normal, except that the DC is based on the level of the spell stored in the glyph.</p>

     <p>A grease spell covers a solid surface with a layer of slippery grease. Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must make a successful Reflex save or fall. This save is repeated on your turn each round that the creature remains within the area. A crea-ture can walk within or through the area of grease at half normal speed with a DC 10 Balance check. Failure means it can’t move that round (and must then make a Reflex save or fall), while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Balance skill for details). The DM should adjust saving throws by circumstance. For example, a creature charging down an incline that is suddenly greased has little chance to avoid the effect, but its ability to exit the affected area is almost assured (whether it wants to or not). The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item—a rope, ladder rungs, or a weapon handle, for instance. Material objects not in use are always af-fected by this spell, while an object wielded or employed by a creature receives a Reflex saving throw to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw fails, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made in each round that the creature attempts to pick up or use the greased item. A creature wearing greased armor or clothing gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks and on grapple checks made to resist or escape a grapple or to escape a pin.</p>

     <p><strong>Ограждение </strong></p>

     <p>This powerful spell is primarily used to defend your stronghold. The ward protects 200 square feet per caster level. The warded area can be as much as 20 feet high, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them; you must be somewhere within the area to be warded to cast the spell. The spell creates the fol-lowing magical effects within the warded area. </p>
     <p>Fog: Fog fills all corridors, obscuring all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: No. Arcane Locks: All doors in the warded area are arcane locked. Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: No. </p>
     <p>Webs: Webs fill all stairs from top to bottom. These strands are identical with those created by the web spell, except that they regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while the guards and wards spell lasts. Saving Throw: Reflex negates; see text for web. Spell Resistance: No. </p>
     <p>Confusion: Where there are choices in direction—such as a corridor intersection or side passage—a minor confusion-type effect functions so as to make it 50% probable that intruders believe they are going in the opposite direction from the one they actually chose. This is an en-chantment, mind-affecting effect. Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: Yes. </p>
     <p>Lost Doors: One door per caster level is covered by a silent image to appear as if it were a plain wall. Saving Throw: Will dis-belief (if interacted with). Spell Resistance: No. </p>
     <p>In addition, you can place your choice of one of the following five magical effects. </p>
     <p>1. Dancing lights in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that causes the lights to repeat as long as the guards and wards spell lasts. Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: No. </p>
     <p>2. A magic mouth in two places. Saving Throw: None. Spell Resistance: No. </p>
     <p>3. A stinking cloud in two places. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while the guards and wards spell lasts. Saving Throw: Fortitude negates; see text for stinking cloud. Spell Resistance: No. </p>
     <p>4. A gust of wind in one corridor or room. Saving Throw: Fortitude negates. Spell Resistance: Yes. </p>
     <p>5. A suggestion in one place. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature who enters or passes through the area receives the suggestion mentally. Saving Throw: Will negates. Spell Resistance: Yes. </p>
     <p>The whole warded area radiates strong magic of the abjuration school. A dispel magic cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect. A successful Mordenkainen’s disjunction destroys the entire guards and wards effect.</p>
     <p>Material Component: Burning incense, a small measure of brimstone and oil, a knotted string, and a small amount of blood.</p>
     <p>Focus: A small silver rod. </p>

     <p>This spell creates a severe blast of air (ap-proximately 50 mph) that originates from you, affecting all creatures in its path. A Tiny or smaller creature on the ground is knocked down and rolled 1d4×10 feet, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet. If flying, a Tiny or smaller creature is blown back 2d6×10 feet and takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage due to battering and buffeting. Small creatures are knocked prone by the force of the wind, or if flying are blown back 1d6×10 feet. Medium creatures are unable to move forward against the force of the wind, or if flying are blown back 1d6×5 feet. Large or larger creatures may move normally within a gust of wind effect. A gust of wind can’t move a creature beyond the limit of its range. Any creature, regardless of size, takes a –4 penalty on ranged attacks and Listen checks in the area of a gust of wind. The force of the gust automatically ex-tinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50% chance to extinguish those lights. In addition to the effects noted, a gust of wind can do anything that a sudden blast of wind would be expected to do. It can create a stinging spray of sand or dust, fan a large fire, overturn delicate awnings or hangings, heel over a small boat, and blow gases or vapors to the edge of its range. Gust of wind can be made permanent with a permanency spell. </p>

     <p>Hallow makes a particular site, building, or structure a holy site. This has four major effects. First, the site or structure is guarded by a magic circle against evil effect. Second, all Charisma checks made to turn undead gain a +4 sacred bonus, and Charisma checks to command undead take a –4 penalty. Spell resistance does not apply to this effect. (This provision does not apply to the druid version of the spell.) Third, any dead body interred in a hal-lowed site cannot be turned into an undead creature. Finally, you may choose to fix a single spell effect to the hallowed site. The spell effect lasts for one year and functions throughout the entire site, regardless of the normal duration and area or effect. You may designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures who share your faith or alignment, or creatures who adhere to another faith or alignment. For example, you may create a bless effect that aids all creatures of your alignment or faith in the area, or a bane effect that hinders creatures of the opposed alignment or an enemy faith. At the end of the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or replaced simply by casting hallow again. Spell effects that may be tied to a hal-lowed site include aid, bane, bless, cause fear, darkness, daylight, death ward, deeper darkness, detect evil, detect magic, dimensional anchor, discern lies, dispel magic, endure elements, freedom of movement, invisibility purge, protection from energy, remove fear, resist energy, silence, tongues, and zone of truth. Saving throws and spell resistance might apply to these spells’ effects. (See the individual spell descriptions for details.) An area can receive only one hallow spell (and its associated spell effect) at a time. Hallow counters but does not dispel unhallow.</p>
     <p>Material Component: Herbs, oils, and incense worth at least 1,000 gp, plus 1,000 gp per level of the spell to be included in the hallowed area. </p>

If the spell is successful, it renders the undead creature immobile for the duration of the spell (similar to the effect of hold person on a living creature).

     <p>The transmuted creatures move and act more quickly than normal. This extra speed has several effects. When making a full attack action, a hasted creature may make one extra attack with any weapon he is holding. The attack is made using the creature’s full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. (This effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as that provided by a weapon of speed, nor does it actually grant an extra action, so you can’t use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round.) A hasted creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves. Any condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses. All of the hasted creature’s modes of movement (including land movement, burrow, climb, fly, and swim) increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice the sub-ject’s normal speed using that form of movement. This increase counts as an enhancement bonus, and it affects the creature’s jumping distance as normal for increased speed. Multiple haste effects don’t stack. Haste dispels and counters slow.</p>

It also cures 10 hit points of damage per level of the caster, to a maximum of 150 points at 15th level.

     <p><sup><strong>Сопротивление магии:</strong> Yes (object) </sup></p>
     <p>Heat metal makes metal extremely warm. Unattended, nonmagical metal gets no saving throw. Magical metal is allowed a saving throw against the spell. (Magic item’s saving throws are covered in the Dungeon Master’s Guide.) An item in a creature’s possession uses the creature’s saving throw bonus unless its own is higher. A creature takes fire damage if its equipment is heated. It takes full damage if its armor is affected or if it is holding, touching, wearing, or carrying metal weighing one-fifth of its weight. The crea-ture takes minimum damage (1 point or 2 points; see the table) if it’s not wearing metal armor and the metal that it’s carry-ing weighs less than one-fifth of its weight. On the first round of the spell, the metal becomes warm and uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage. The same effect also occurs on the last round of the spell’s duration. During the second (and also the next-to-last) round, intense heat causes pain and damage. In the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is searing hot, causing more damage, as shown on the table below. Metal Round Temperature Damage 1 Warm None 2 Hot 1d4 points 3–5 Searing 2d4 points 6 Hot 1d4 points 7 Warm None Any cold intense enough to damage the creature negates fire damage from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-for-point basis. For example, if the damage roll from a heat metal spell indicates 2 points of fire damage and the subject is hit by a ray of frost in the same round and takes 3 points of cold damage, it winds up taking no fire damage and only 1 point of cold damage. If cast underwater, heat metal deals half damage and boils the surrounding water. Heat metal counters and dispels chill metal. </p>

     <p>You create the ghostly image of a hand, which you can send to find a creature within 5 miles. The hand then beckons to that creature and leads it to you if the crea-ture is willing to follow. When the spell is cast, the hand appears in front of you. You then specify a person (or any creature) by physical description, which can include race, gender, and appearance but not ambiguous factors such as level, alignment, or class. When the description is complete, the hand streaks off in search of a subject that fits the description. The amount of time it takes to find the subject depends on how far away she is. Distance Time to Locate 100 ft. or less 1 round 1,000 ft. 1 minute 1 mile 10 minutes 2 miles 1 hour 3 miles 2 hours 4 miles 3 hours 5 miles 4 hours Once the hand locates the subject, it beck-ons the creature to follow it. If the subject does so, the hand points in your direction, indicating the most direct feasible route. The hand hovers 10 feet in front of the subject, moving before it at a speed of as much as 240 feet per round. Once the hand leads the subject back to you, it disappears. The subject is not compelled to follow the hand or act in any particular way to-ward you. If the subject chooses not to follow, the hand continues to beckon for the duration of the spell, then disappears. If the spell expires while the subject is en route to you, the hand disappears; the subject must then rely on her own devices to locate you. If more than one sub-ject in a 5-mile radius meets the description, the hand locates the closest creature. If that creature refuses to follow the hand, the hand does not seek out a second subject. If, at the end of 4 hours of searching, the hand has found no subject that matches the description within 5 miles, it returns to you, displays an outstretched palm (indica-ting that no such creature was found), and disappears. The ghostly hand has no physical form. It is invisible to anyone except you and a potential subject. It cannot engage in com-bat or execute any other task aside from locating a subject and leading it back to you. The hand can’t pass through solid objects but can ooze through small cracks and slits. The hand cannot travel more than 5 miles from the spot it appeared when you cast the spell. </p>

     <p>A brilliant divine radiance surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by evil creatures, and causing evil creatures to become blinded when they strike the subjects. This abjuration has four effects. First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike protection from evil, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by evil creatures. Second, each warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against evil spells and spells cast by evil creatures. Third, the abjuration blocks possession and mental influence, just as protection from evil does. Finally, if an evil creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the offending attacker is blinded (Fortitude save negates, as blindness/deafness, but against holy aura’s save DC).</p>
     <p>Focus: A tiny reliquary containing some sacred relic, such as a scrap of cloth from a saint’s robe or a piece of parchment from a holy text. The reliquary costs at least 500 gp. </p>

     <p>You draw down holy power to smite your enemies. Only evil and neutral creatures are harmed by the spell; good creatures are unaffected. The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to each evil creature in the area (or 1d6 points of damage per caster level, maximum 10d6, to an evil outsider) and causes it to become blinded for 1 round. A successful Will saving throw reduces damage to half and negates the blinded effect. The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither good nor evil, and they are not blinded. Such a creature can reduce that damage by half (down to one-quarter of the roll) with a successful Will save. </p>

     <p>This spell allows you to channel holy power into your sword, or any other melee weapon you choose. The weapon acts as a +5 holy weapon (+5 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls, extra 2d6 damage against evil opponents). It also emits a magic circle against evil effect (as the spell). If the magic circle ends, the sword creates a new one on your turn as a free action. The spell is automatically canceled 1 round after the weapon leaves your hand. You cannot have more than one holy sword at a time. If this spell is cast on a magic weapon, the powers of the spell supersede any that the weapon normally has, rendering the normal enhancement bonus and powers of the weapon inoperative for the duration of the spell. This spell is not cumulative with bless weapon or any other spell that might modify the weapon in any way. This spell does not work on artifacts. Note: A masterwork weapon’s bonus to attack does not stack with an enhancement bonus to attack. </p>

Paralyzed: The creature is paralyzed and helpless for 1d10 minutes. Killed: Living creatures die. Undead creatures are destroyed. Furthermore, if you are on your home plane when you cast this spell, nongood extraplanar creatures within the area are instantly banished back to their home planes. Creatures so banished cannot return for at least 24 hours. This effect takes place regardless of whether the crea-tures hear the holy word. The banishment effect allows a Will save (at a –4 penalty) to negate. Creatures whose HD exceed your caster level are unaffected by holy word. </p>

     <p>Your gestures and droning incantation fascinate nearby creatures, causing them to stop and stare blankly at you. In addition, you can use their rapt attention to make your suggestions and requests seem more plausible. Roll 2d4 to see how many total Hit Dice of creatures you affect. Creatures with fewer HD are affected before creatures with more HD. Only creatures that can see or hear you are affected, but they do not need to understand you to be fascinated. If you use this spell in combat, each target gains a +2 bonus on its saving throw. If the spell affects only a single creature not in combat at the time, the saving throw has a penalty of –2. While the subject is fascinated by this spell, it reacts as though it were two steps more friendly in attitude (see Influencing NPC Attitudes, page 72). This allows you to make a single request of the affected creature (provided you can communicate with it). The request must be brief and rea-sonable. Even after the spell ends, the creature retains its new attitude toward you, but only with respect to that particu-lar request. A creature that fails its saving throw does not remember that you enspelled it. </p>

     <p>You write instructions or other informa-tion on parchment, paper, or any suitable writing material. The illusory script appears to be some form of foreign or magical writing. Only the person (or people) des-ignated by you at the time of the casting are able to read the writing; it’s unintelli-gible to any other character, although an illusionist recognizes it as illusory script. Any unauthorized creature attempting to read the script triggers a potent illusory effect and must make a saving throw. A successful saving throw means the crea-ture can look away with only a mild sense of disorientation. Failure means the crea-ture is subject to a suggestion implanted in the script by you at the time the illusory script spell was cast. The suggestion lasts only 30 minutes. Typical suggestions include “Close the book and leave,” “Forget the existence of the book,” and so forth. If successfully dispelled by dispel magic, the illusory script and its secret message disappear. The hidden message can be read by a combination of the true seeing spell with the read magic or comprehend languages spell. The casting time depends on how long a message you wish to write, but it is always at least 1 minute.</p>

     <p>This spell creates the illusion of a wall, floor, ceiling, or similar surface. It appears absolutely real when viewed, but physical objects can pass through it without diffi-culty. When the spell is used to hide pits, traps, or normal doors, any detection abil-ities that do not require sight work nor-mally. Touch or a probing search reveals the true nature of the surface, though such measures do not cause the illusion to disappear. </p>

     <p>You transfer some of your currently pre-pared spells, and the ability to cast them, to another creature. Only a creature with an Intelligence score of at least 5 and a Wisdom score of at least 9 can receive this bestowal. Only cleric spells from the schools of abjuration, divination, and conjuration (healing) can be transferred. The number and level of spells that the subject can be granted depends on its Hit Dice; even multiple castings of imbue with spell ability can’t exceed this limit. HD of Spells Recipient Imbued 2 or lower One 1st-level spell 3–4 One or two 1st-level spells 5 or higher One or two 1st-level spells and one 2nd-level spell The transferred spell’s variable character-istics (range, duration, area, and the like) function according to your level, not the level of the recipient. Once you cast imbue with spell ability, you cannot prepare a new 4th-level spell to replace it until the recipient uses the imbued spells or is slain, or until you dis-miss the imbue with spell ability spell. In the meantime, you remain responsible to your deity or your principles for the use to which the spell is put. If the number of 4th-level spells you can cast decreases, and that number drops below your current number of active imbue with spell ability spells, the more recently cast imbued spells are dispelled. To cast a spell with a verbal component, the subject must be able to speak. To cast a spell with a somatic component, it must have humanlike hands. To cast a spell with a material component or focus, it must have the materials or focus. </p>

     <p>When you cast imprisonment and touch a creature, it is entombed in a state of sus-pended animation (see the temporal stasis spell) in a small sphere far beneath the surface of the earth. The subject remains there unless a freedom spell is cast at the locale where the imprisonment took place. Magical search by a crystal ball, a locate object spell, or some other similar divination does not reveal the fact that a creature is imprisoned, but discern location does. A wish or miracle spell will not free the recipient, but will reveal where it is entombed. If you know the target’s name and some facts about its life, the target takes a –4 penalty on its save. </p>

     <p><sup><strong>Сопротивление магии:</strong> No </sup></p>
     <p>An incendiary cloud spell creates a cloud of roiling smoke shot through with white-hot embers. The smoke obscures all sight as a fog cloud does. In addition, the white-hot embers within the cloud deal 4d6 points of fire damage to everything within the cloud on your turn each round. All targets can make Reflex saves each round to take half damage. As with a cloudkill spell, the smoke moves away from you at 10 feet per round. Figure out the smoke’s new spread each round based on its new point of origin, which is 10 feet farther away from where you were when you cast the spell. By con-centrating, you can make the cloud (actu-ally its point of origin) move as much as 60 feet each round. Any portion of the cloud that would extend beyond your maximum range dissipates harmlessly, reducing the remainder’s spread thereafter. As with fog cloud, wind disperses the smoke, and the spell can’t be cast under-water. </p>

     <p>The creature or object touched becomes invisible, vanishing from sight, even from darkvision. If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by an in-visible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible, such as a trailing rope. Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle). The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. (Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character’s per-ceptions.) Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it im-mediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as bless that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area. See Table 8–5: Attack Roll Modifiers and Table 8–6: Armor Class Modifiers, page 151, for the effects of invisibility on combat. Invisibility can be made permanent (on objects only) with a permanency spell. </p>

     <p>This spell transforms your body into living iron, which grants you several powerful resistances and abilities. You gain damage reduction 15/adaman-tine. You are immune to blindness, critical hits, ability score damage, deafness, dis-ease, drowning, electricity, poison, stun-ning, and all spells or attacks that affect your physiology or respiration, because you have no physiology or respiration while this spell is in effect. You take only half damage from acid and fire of all kinds. However, you also become vulnerable to all special attacks that affect iron golems. You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to your Strength score, but you take a –6 penalty to Dexterity as well (to a minimum Dexterity score of 1), and your speed is reduced to half normal. You have an arcane spell failure chance of 50% and a –8 armor check penalty, just as if you were clad in full plate armor. You cannot drink (and thus can’t use potions) or play wind instru-ments. Your unarmed attacks deal damage equal to a club sized for you (1d4 for Small characters or 1d6 for Medium characters), and you are considered armed when making unarmed attacks. Your weight increases by a factor of ten, causing you to sink in water like a stone. However, you could survive the crushing pressure and lack of air at the bottom of the ocean—at least until the spell duration expires. </p>

     <p>Ironwood is a magical substance created by druids from normal wood. While re-maining natural wood in almost every way, ironwood is as strong, heavy, and resistant to fire as steel. Spells that affect metal or iron (such as heat metal) do not function on ironwood. Spells that affect wood (such as wood shape) do affect ironwood, although ironwood does not burn. Using this spell with wood shape or a wood-related Craft check, you can fashion wooden items that function as steel items. Thus, wooden plate armor and wooden swords can be created that are as durable as their normal steel counterparts. These items are freely usable by druids. Further, if you make only half as much ironwood as the spell would normally allow, any weapon, shield, or suit of armor so created is treated as a magic item with a +1 enhancement bonus.</p>

     <p>This spell makes a weapon magically keen, improving its ability to deal telling blows. This transmutation doubles the threat range of the weapon. A threat range of 20 becomes 19–20, a threat range of 19–20 becomes 17–20, and a threat range of 18–20 becomes 15–20. The spell can be cast only on piercing or slashing weapons. If cast on arrows or crossbow bolts, the keen edge on a particular projectile ends after one use, whether or not the missile strikes its intended target. (Treat shuriken as arrows, rather than as thrown weapons, for the purpose of this spell.) Multiple effects that increase a weapon’s threat range (such as the keen edge spell and the Improved Critical feat) don’t stack. You can’t cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as a claw. </p>

     <p>The knock spell opens stuck, barred, locked, held, or arcane locked doors. It opens secret doors, as well as locked or trick-opening boxes or chests. It also loosens welds, shackles, or chains (provided they serve to hold closures shut). If used to open a arcane locked door, the spell does not remove the arcane lock but simply suspends its functioning for 10 minutes. In all other cases, the door does not relock itself or become stuck again on its own. Knock does not raise barred gates or similar impedi-ments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the like. The effect is limited by the area. A 3rd-level caster can cast a knock spell on a door of 30 square feet or less (for example, a standard 4-foot-by-7-foot door). Each spell can undo as many as two means of preventing egress. Thus if a door is locked, barred, and held, or quadruple locked, opening it requires two knock spells. </p>

Your knowledge of north is correct at the moment of casting, but you can get lost again within moments if you don’t find some external reference point to help you keep track of direction. </p>

     <p>Legend lore brings to your mind legends about an important person, place, or thing. If the person or thing is at hand, or if you are in the place in question, the casting time is only 1d4×10 minutes. If you have only detailed information on the person, place, or thing, the casting time is 1d10 days, and the resulting lore is less complete and specific (though it often provides enough information to help you find the person, place, or thing, thus allowing a better legend lore result next time). If you know only rumors, the casting time is 2d6 weeks, and the resulting lore is vague and incomplete (though it often directs you to more detailed information, thus allowing a better legend lore result next time). During the casting, you cannot engage in other than routine activities: eating, sleeping, and so forth. When completed, the divination brings legends (if any) about the person, place, or things to your mind. These may be legends that are still current, legends that have been forgotten, or even information that has never been generally known. If the person, place, or thing is not of legendary importance, you gain no information. As a rule of thumb, characters who are 11th level and higher are “legendary,” as are the sorts of creatures they contend with, the major magic items they wield, and the places where they perform their key deeds. Examples of legend lore results include the following. A divination about a mysterious magic axe you have at hand: “Woe to the evildoer whose hand touches the axe, for even the haft chops the hand of the evil ones. Only a true Son or Daughter of Stone, one who loves Moradin and whom Moradin loves, may awaken the true powers of the axe, and only with the sacred word ‘Rudnogg’ on the lips.” A divination about a legendary paladin about whom you know many details: “Vanashon has been denied the glory of death and the duty of life. He waits pa-tiently beneath the Forbidden Mountain.” (The paladin has been turned to stone in the caverns under the mountain.) A divination about ancient ruins about which you have only a passing reference in a partially damaged tome: “The sorcerer who called herself Ryth built a library without words and a temple without gods. Those tho read and those who pray tore it down in a night and a day.” (These clues may be enough for you to find out more and get details you need to cast a better legend lore.) Material Component: Incense worth at least 250 gp.</p>
     <p>Focus: Four strips of ivory (worth 50 gp each) formed into a rectangle. </p>

     <p><sup><strong>Продолжительность:</strong> Sixty days or until discharged </sup></p>
     <p><sup><strong>Спасбросок:</strong> None </sup></p>
     <p><sup><strong>Сопротивление магии:</strong> No </sup></p>
     <p>You hide a chest on the Ethereal Plane for as long as sixty days and can retrieve it at will. The chest can contain up to 1 cubic foot of material per caster level (regardless of the chest’s actual size, which is about 3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet). If any living creatures are in the chest, there is a 75% chance that the spell simply fails. Once the chest is hidden, you can retrieve it by concentrating (a standard action), and it appears next to you. The chest must be exceptionally well crafted and expensive, constructed for you by master crafters. If made principally of wood, it must be ebony, rosewood, sandal-wood, teak, or the like, and all of its corner fittings, nails, and hardware must be plat-inum. If constructed of ivory, the metal fittings of the chest must be gold. If the chest is fashioned from bronze, copper, or silver, its fittings must be silver or electrum (a valuable metal). The cost of such a chest is never less than 5,000 gp. Once it is constructed, you must make a tiny replica (of the same materials and perfect in every detail), so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a per-fect copy. (The replica costs 50 gp.) You can have but one pair of these chests at any given time—even a wish spell does not allow more. The chests are nonmagical and can be fitted with locks, wards, and so on, just as any normal chest can be. To hide the chest, you cast the spell while touching both the chest and the replica. The chest vanishes into the Ethe-real Plane. You need the replica to recall the chest. After sixty days, there is a cumulative chance of 5% per day that the chest is irretrievably lost. If the miniature of the chest is lost or destroyed, there is no way, not even with a wish spell, that the large chest can be summoned back, al-though an extraplanar expedition might be mounted to find it. Living things in the chest eat, sleep, and age normally, and they die if they run out of food, air, water, or whatever they need to survive.</p>
     <p>Focus: The chest and its replica. </p>

     <p>You conjure a sturdy cottage or lodge made of material that is common in the area where the spell is cast—stone, timber, or (at worst) sod. The floor is level, clean, and dry. In all respects the lodging resembles a normal cottage, with a sturdy door, two shuttered windows, and a small fireplace. The shelter has no heating or cooling source (other than natural insulation qualities). Therefore, it must be heated as a normal dwelling, and extreme heat ad-versely affects it and its occupants. The dwelling does, however, provide consid-erable security otherwise—it is as strong as a normal stone building, regardless of its material composition. The dwelling resists flames and fire as if it were stone. It is impervious to normal missiles (but not the sort cast by siege engines or giants). The door, shutters, and even chimney are secure against intrusion, the former two being arcane locked and the latter se-cured by an iron grate at the top and a narrow flue. In addition, these three areas are protected by an alarm spell. Finally, an unseen servant is conjured to provide ser-vice to you for the duration of the shelter. The secure shelter contains rude furnish-ings—eight bunks, a trestle table, eight stools, and a writing desk.</p>
     <p>Material Component: A square chip of stone, crushed lime, a few grains of sand, a sprinkling of water, and several splinters of wood. These must be augmented by the components of the unseen servant spell (string and a bit of wood) if this benefit is to be included.</p>
     <p>Focus: The focus of the alarm spell (silver wire and a tiny bell) if this benefit is to be included. </p>

     <p>You create an unmoving, opaque sphere of force of any color you desire around yourself. Half the sphere projects above the ground, and the lower hemisphere passes through the ground. As many as nine other Medium creatures can fit into the field with you; they can freely pass into and out of the hut without harming it. However, if you remove yourself from the hut, the spell ends. The temperature inside the hut is 70° F if the exterior temperature is between 0° and 100° F. An exterior temperature below 0° or above 100° lowers or raises the interior temperature on a 1-degree-for-1 basis (thus, if it’s –20° outside, inside the hut it’s 50°). The hut also provides protec-tion against the elements, such as rain, dust, and sandstorms. The hut withstands any wind of less than hurricane force, but a hurricane (75+ mph wind speed) or greater force destroys it. The interior of the hut is a hemisphere. You can illuminate it dimly upon com-mand or extinguish the light as desired. Although the force field is opaque from the outside, it is transparent from within. Missiles, weapons, and most spell effects can pass through the hut without affecting it, although the occupants cannot be seen from outside the hut (they have total concealment).</p>

     <p>This spell makes a lock or small mechanism seem to be trapped to anyone who can detect traps. You place the spell upon any small mechanism or device, such as a lock, hinge, hasp, cork, cap, or ratchet. Any character able to detect traps, or who uses any spell or device enabling trap detection, is 100% certain a real trap exists. Of course, the effect is illusory and nothing happens if the trap is “sprung”; its primary purpose is to frighten away thieves or make them waste precious time. If another Leomund’s trap is active within 50 feet when the spell is cast, the casting fails.</p>
     <p>Material Component: A piece of iron pyrite touched to the object to the trapped while the object is sprinkled with a special dust requiring 50gp to prepare. Lesser (Spell Name) Any spell whose name begins with lesser is alphabetized in this chapter according to the second word of the spell name. Thus, the description of a lesser spell appears near the description of the spell on which it is based. Spell chains that have lesser spells in them include those based on the spells confusion, geas, globe of invulnerability, planar ally, planar binding, and restoration. </p>

     <p>Levitate allows you to move yourself, an-other creature, or an object up and down as you wish. A creature must be willing to be levitated, and an object must be unattended or possessed by a willing creature. You can mentally direct the recipient to move up or down as much as 20 feet each round; doing so is a move action. You cannot move the recipient horizontally, but the recipient could clamber along the face of a cliff, for example, or push against a ceiling to move laterally (generally at half its base land speed). A levitating creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself in-creasingly unstable; the first attack has a –1 penalty on attack rolls, the second –2, and so on, to a maximum penalty of –5. A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at –1.</p>

     <p>A limited wish lets you create nearly any type of effect. For example, a limited wish can do any of the following things. Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you. Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you. Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 5th level or lower, even if it’s of a pro-hibited school. Duplicate any other spell of 4th level or lower, even if it’s of a prohibited school. Undo the harmful effects of many spells, such as geas/quest or insanity. Produce any other effect whose power level is in line with the above effects, such as a single creature automatically hitting on its next attack or taking a –7 penalty on its next saving throw. A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal (but the save DC is for a 7th-level spell). When a limited wish duplicates a spell that has an XP cost, you must pay that cost or 300 XP, whichever is more. When a limited wish spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 1,000 gp, you must provide that component. </p>

     <p>This spell turns an oak tree into a protector or guardian. The spell can be cast on only a single tree at a time; while liveoak is in effect, you can’t cast it again on another tree. The tree on which the spell is cast must be within 10 feet of your dwelling place, within a place sacred to you, or within 300 feet of something that you wish to guard or protect. Liveoak must be cast on a healthy, Huge oak. A triggering phrase of up to one word per caster level is placed on the targeted oak. For instance, “Attack any persons who come near without first saying ‘sacred mistletoe’ “ is an eleven-word trigger phrase that you could use at 11th level or higher. The liveoak spell triggers the tree into animating as a treant (see the Monster Manual). At the DM’s option, you can extrapolate statistics for a smaller tree from the treant statistics if you cast likeoak on a smaller oak. If liveoak is dispelled, the tree takes root immediately, wherever it happens to be. If released by you, the tree tries to return to its original location before taking root. </p>

     <p>This spell functions like locate object, except this spell locates a known or familiar creature. You slowly turn and sense when you are facing in the direction of the creature to be located, provided it is within range. You also know in which direction the creature is moving, if any. The spell can locate a creature of a spe-cific kind (such as a human or a unicorn) or a specific creature known to you. It cannot find a creature of a certain type (such as humanoid or animal). To find a kind of creature, you must have seen such a creature up close (within 30 feet) at least once. Running water blocks the spell. It cannot detect objects. It can be fooled by mislead, nondetection, and polymorph spells.</p>

     <p>You sense the direction of a well-known or clearly visualized object. The spell locates such objects as apparel, jewelry, furniture, tools, weapons, or even a ladder. You can search for general items such as a stairway, a sword, or a jewel, in which case you locate the nearest one of its kind if more than one is within range. Attempting to find a certain item, such as a particular piece of jewelry, requires a specific and accurate mental image; if the image is not close enough to the actual object, the spell fails. You cannot specify a unique item (such as “Baron Vulden’s signet ring”) unless you have observed that particular item firsthand (not through divination). The spell is blocked by even a thin sheet of lead. Creatures cannot be found by this spell. Polymorph any object fools it. </p>

     <p>All creatures within the area gain the effects of a protection from evil spell, and no nongood summoned creatures can enter the area either. You must overcome a crea-ture’s spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of protection from evil), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies’ spell resistance. This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it. A magic circle against evil can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the lesser planar binding, planar binding, and greater planar binding spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the magic circle. The creature cannot cross the circle’s boun-daries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell’s area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal protection from evil spell for that creature only. A magic circle leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that dis-turbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, des-troying the circle. A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through that means. You can prevent the creature’s extradimensional escape by cast-ing a dimensional anchor spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the anchor effect lasts as long as the magic circle does. The creature cannot reach across the magic circle, but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself. You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the magic circle more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. The DM makes this check secretly. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 (see page 65) when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task. This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20. A successful diagram allows you to cast a dimensional anchor spell on the magic circle during the round before casting any summoning spell. The anchor holds any called creatures in the magic circle for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a magic circle prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the lesser planar binding spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if any-thing disturbs the diagram—even a straw laid across it. However, the creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above. This spell is not cumulative with protec-tion from evil and vice versa. </p>
     <p>Arcane Material Component: A little pow-dered silver with which you trace a 3-foot-diameter circle on the floor (or ground) around the creature to be warded. </p>

     <p><sup><strong>Сопротивление магии:</strong> Yes </sup></p>
     <p>By casting magic jar, you place your soul in a gem or large crystal (known as the magic jar), leaving your body lifeless. Then you can attempt to take control of a nearby body, forcing its soul into the magic jar. You may move back to the jar (thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and attempt to possess another body. The spell ends when you send your soul back to your own body, leaving the receptacle empty. To cast the spell, the magic jar must be within spell range and you must know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or line of effect to it. When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body is, as near as anyone can tell, dead. While in the magic jar, you can sense and attack any life force within 10 feet per caster level (and on the same plane of existence). You do need line of effect from the jar to the creatures. You cannot deter-mine the exact creature types or positions of these creatures. In a group of life forces, you can sense a difference of 4 or more Hit Dice between one creature and another and can determine whether a life force is powered by positive or negative energy. (Undead creatures are powered by negative energy. Only sentient undead creatures have, or are, souls.) For example, if two 10th-level characters are attacking a hill giant (12 HD) and four ogres (4 HD), you could determine that there are three stronger and four weaker life forces within the range, all powered by positive energy. You could choose to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but which particular stronger or weaker creature you attempt to possess is determined randomly. Attempting to possess a body is a full-round action. It is blocked by protection from evil or a similar ward. You possess the body and force the creature’s soul into the magic jar unless the subject succeeds on a Will save. Failure to take over the host leaves your life force in the magic jar, and the target automatically succeeds on fur-ther saving throws if you attempt to pos-sess its body again. If you are successful, your life force oc-cupies the host body, and the host’s life force is imprisoned in the magic jar. You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Cha-risma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abili-ties. The body retains its Strength, Dex-terity, Constitution, hit points, natural abi-lities, and automatic abilities. For example, a fish’s body breathes water and a troll’s body regenerates. A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon at-tacks) than normal. You can’t choose to activate the body’s extraordinary or super-natural abilities. The creature’s spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body. As a standard action, you can shift freely from a host to the magic jar if within range, sending the trapped soul back to its body. The spell ends when you shift from the jar to your own body. If the host body is slain, you return to the magic jar, if within range, and the life force of the host departs (it is dead). If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both you and the host die. Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain. If the spell ends while you are in the magic jar, you return to your body (or die if your body is out of range or destroyed). If the spell ends while you are in a host, you return to your body (or die, if it is out of range of your current position), and the soul in the magic jar returns to its body (or dies if it is out of range). Destroying the receptacle ends the spell, and the spell can be dispelled at either the magic jar or at the host’s location.</p>

     <p>This spell imbues the chosen object or creature with an enchanted mouth that suddenly appears and speaks its message the next time a specified event occurs. The message, which must be twenty-five or fewer words long, can be in any language known by you and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes. The mouth cannot utter verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects. It does, however, move according to the words articulated; if it were placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would move and appear to speak. Of course, magic mouth can be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other object or creature. The spell functions when specific con-ditions are fulfilled according to your command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used, such as the following: “Speak only when a venerable female human car-rying a sack sits cross-legged within a dis-tance of one foot.” Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illu-sions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical darkness or invisibility does. Silent movement or magical silence defeats audi-ble triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises (footsteps, metal clanking) or to a specific noise or spoken word (when a pin drops, or when anyone says “Boo”). Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. For example, “Speak when any creature touches the statue” is an acceptable command if the creature is visible. A magic mouth cannot distinguish alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class except by external garb. The range limit of a trigger is 15 feet per caster level, so a 6th-level caster can command a magic mouth to respond to triggers as far as 90 feet away. Regardless of range, the mouth can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance. Magic mouth can be made permanent with a permanency spell.</p>

     <p>This spell functions like magic weapon, except that it gives a weapon an enhance-ment bonus on attack and damage rolls of +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5). Alternatively, you can affect as many as fifty arrows, bolts, or bullets. The projec-tiles must be of the same kind, and they have to be together (in the same quiver or other container). Projectiles, but not thrown weapons, lose their transmutation when used. (Treat shuriken as projectiles, rather than as thrown weapons, for the purpose of this spell.) </p>

     <p>This spell functions like minor creation, ex-cept that you can also create an object of mineral nature: stone, crystal, metal, or the like. The duration of the created item varies with its relative hardness and rarity, as indicated on the following table. Hardness and Rarity Examples Duration Vegetable matter 2 hr./level Stone, crystal, base metals 1 hr./level Precious metals 20 min./level Gems 10 min./level Rare metal1 1 round/level 1 Includes adamantine, alchemical silver, and mithral.

     <p>When moral persuasion fails to win a criminal over to right conduct, you can use mark of justice to encourage the miscreant to walk the straight and narrow path. You draw an indelible mark on the sub-ject and state some behavior on the part of the subject that will activate the mark. When activated, the mark curses the sub-ject. Typically, you designate some sort of criminal behavior that activates the mark, but you can pick any act you please. The effect of the mark is identical with the effect of bestow curse. Since this spell takes 10 minutes to cast and involves writing on the target, you can cast it only on a creature that is willing or restrained. Like the effect of bestow curse, a mark of justice cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell. Remove curse works only if its caster level is equal to or higher than your mark of justice caster level. These restrictions apply regar-dless of whether the mark has activated. Mass (Spell Name) Any spell whose name begins with mass is alphabetized in this chapter according to the second word of the spell name. Thus, the description of a mass spell appears near the description of the spell on which it is based. Spell chains that have mass spells in them include those based on the spells bear’s endurance, bull’s strength, cat’s grace, charm monster, cure critical wounds, cure light wounds, cure moderate wounds, cure serious wounds, eagle’s splendor, enlarge person, fox’s cunning, heal, hold monster, hold person, inflict critical wounds, inflict light wounds, inflict moderate wounds, inflict serious wounds, invisibility, owl’s wisdom, reduce person, and suggestion. </p>

     <p>You banish the subject into an extradi-mensional labyrinth of force planes. Each round on its turn, it may attempt a DC 20 Intelligence check to escape the labyrinth as a full-round action. If the subject doesn’t escape, the maze disappears after 10 minutes, forcing the subject to leave. On escaping or leaving the maze, the subject reappears where it had been when the maze spell was cast. If this location is filled with a solid object, the subject appears in the nearest open space. Spells and abilities that move a creature within a plane, such as teleport and di-mension door, do not help a creature escape a maze spell, although a plane shift spell allows it to exit to whatever plane is desig-nated in that spell. Minotaurs are not affected by this spell. </p>

     <p>Meld into stone enables you to meld your body and possessions into a single block of stone. The stone must be large enough to accommodate your body in all three dim-ensions. When the casting is complete, you and not more than 100 pounds of nonliving gear merge with the stone. If either condition is violated, the spell fails and is wasted. While in the stone, you remain in con-tact, however tenuous, with the face of the stone through which you melded. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while hiding in the stone. Nothing that goes on outside the stone can be seen, but you can still hear what happens around you. Minor physical damage to the stone does not harm you, but its partial destruction (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage. The stone’s complete destruction expels you and slays you instantly unless you make a DC 18 Fortitude save. Any time before the duration expires, you can step out of the stone through the surface that you entered. If the spell’s duration expires or the effect is dispelled before you voluntarily exit the stone, you are violently expelled and take 5d6 points of damage. The following spells harm you if cast upon the stone that you are occupying: Stone to flesh expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage. Stone shape deals you 3d6 points of damage but does not expel you. Transmute rock to mud expels you and then slays you instantly unless you make a DC 18 Fortitude save, in which case you are merely expelled. Finally, passwall expels you without damage. </p>

The spell can repair a magic item, but the item’s magical abilities are not restored. (For restoring a broken magic item’s abilities, see the item creation feats in Chapter 5: Feats.)

     <p>You can whisper messages and receive whispered replies with little chance of be-ing overheard. You point your finger at each creature you want to receive the message. When you whisper, the whis-pered message is audible to all targeted creatures within range. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal (or a thin sheet of lead), or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks the spell. The message does not have to travel in a straight line. It can circumvent a barrier if there is an open path between you and the subject, and the path’s entire length lies within the spell’s range. The creatures that receive the mes-sage can whisper a reply that you hear. The spell transmits sound, not meaning. It doesn’t transcend language barriers. Note: To speak a message, you must mouth the words and whisper, possibly al-lowing observers the opportunity to read your lips.</p>

     <p>Meteor swarm is a very powerful and spec-tacular spell that is similar to fireball in many aspects. When you cast it, four 2- foot-diameter spheres spring from your outstretched hand and streak in straight lines to the spots you select. The meteor spheres leave a fiery trail of sparks. If you aim a sphere at a specific creature, you may make a ranged touch attack to strike the target with the meteor. Any creature struck by one of these spheres takes 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage (no save) and receives no saving throw against the sphere’s fire damage (see below). If a targeted sphere misses its tar-get, it simply explodes at the nearest corner of the target’s space. You may aim more than one meteor at the same target. Once a sphere reaches its destination, it explodes in a 40-foot-radius spread, dealing 6d6 points of fire damage to each creature in the area. If a creature is within the area of more than one sphere, it must save sepa-rately against each. (Fire resistance applies to each sphere’s damage individually.) </p>

     <p>Mind fog produces a bank of thin mist that weakens the mental resistance of those caught in it. Creatures in the mind fog take a –10 competence penalty on Wisdom checks and Will saves. (A creature that suc-cessfully saves against the fog is not affected and need not make further saves even if it remains in the fog.) Affected creatures take the penalty as long as they remain in the fog and for 2d6 rounds thereafter. The fog is stationary and lasts for 30 minutes (or until dispersed by wind). A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in four rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round. The fog is thin and does not signifi-cantly hamper vision. </p>

     <p>You don’t so much cast a miracle as request one. You state what you would like to have happen and request that your deity (or the power you pray to for spells) intercede. The DM then determines the particular effect of the miracle. A miracle can do any of the following things. Duplicate any cleric spell of 8th level or lower (including spells to which you have access because of your domains). Duplicate any other spell of 7th level or lower. Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as feeblemind or insanity. Have any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects. If the miracle has any of the above effects, casting it has no experience point cost. Alternatively, a cleric can make a very powerful request. Casting such a miracle costs the cleric 5,000 XP because of the powerful divine energies involved. Ex-amples of especially powerful miracles of this sort could include the following. Swinging the tide of a battle in your favor by raising fallen allies to continue fighting. Moving you and your allies, with all your and their gear, from one plane to another through planar barriers to a specific locale with no chance of error. Protecting a city from an earthquake, volcanic eruption, flood, or other major natural disaster. In any event, a request that is out of line with the deity’s (or alignment’s) nature is refused. A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DCs are as for a 9th-level spell. When a miracle duplicates a spell that has an XP cost, you must pay that cost. When a mir-acle spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 100 gp, you must provide that component. </p>

     <p>Several illusory duplicates of you pop into being, making it difficult for enemies to know which target to attack. The figments stay near you and disappear when struck. Mirror image creates 1d4 images plus one image per three caster levels (maximum eight images total). These figments separate from you and remain in a cluster, each within 5 feet of at least one other fig-ment or you. You can move into and through a mirror image. When you and the mirror image separate, observers can’t use vision or hearing to tell which one is you and which the image. The figments may also move through each other. The fig-ments mimic your actions, pretending to cast spells when you cast a spell, drink potions when you drink a potion, levitate when you levitate, and so on. Enemies attempting to attack you or cast spells at you must select from among indistinguishable targets. Generally, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment. Any successful attack against an image destroys it. An image’s AC is 10 + your size modifier + your Dex modifier. Figments seem to react normally to area spells (such as looking like they’re burned or dead after being hit by a fireball). While moving, you can merge with and split off from figments so that enemies who have learned which image is real are again confounded. An attacker must be able to see the images to be fooled. If you are invisible or an attacker shuts his or her eyes, the spell has no effect. (Being unable to see carries the same penalties as being blinded.) </p>

     <p>By means of this spell, you misdirect the information from divination spells that reveal auras (detect evil, detect magic, discern lies, and the like). On casting the spell, you choose another object within range. For the duration of the spell, the subject of misdirection is detected as if it were the other object. (Neither the subject nor the other object gets a saving throw against this effect.) Detection spells provide in-formation based on the second object rather than on the actual target of the detection unless the caster of the detection succeeds on a Will save. For instance, you could make yourself detect as a tree if one were within range at casting: not evil, not lying, not magical, neutral in alignment, and so forth. This spell does not affect other types of divination magic (augury, detect thoughts, clairaudience/clairvoyance, and the like). </p>

     <p>You become invisible (as improved invisi-bility, a glamer), and at the same time, an illusory double of you (as major image, a figment) appears. You are then free to go elsewhere while your double moves away. The double appears within range but thereafter moves as you direct it (which requires concentration beginning on the first round after the casting). You can make the figment appear superimposed perfectly over your own body so that observers don’t notice an image appearing and you turning invisible. You and the figment can then move in different directions. The double moves at your speed and can talk and gesture as if it were real, but it cannot attack or cast spells, though it can pretend to do so. The illusory double lasts as long as you concentrate upon it, plus 3 additional rounds. After you cease concentration, the illusory double continues to carry out the same activity (for instance, fleeing down a hallway) until the duration expires. The improved invisibility lasts for 1 round per level, regardless of concentration. </p>

     <p>You reach into the subject’s mind and modify as many as 5 minutes of its memo-ries in one of the following ways. Eliminate all memory of an event the subject actually experienced. This spell cannot negate charm, geas/quest, sugges-tion, or similar spells. Allow the subject to recall with perfect clarity an event it actually experienced. For instance, it could recall every word from a 5-minute conversation or every detail from a passage in a book. Change the details of an event the sub-ject actually experienced. Implant a memory of an event the sub-ject never experienced. Casting the spell takes 1 round. If the sub-ject fails to save, you proceed with the spell by spending as much as 5 minutes (a period of time equal to the amount of memory time you want to modify) visual-izing the memory you wish to modify in the subject. If your concentration is dis-turbed before the visualization is complete, or if the subject is ever beyond the spell’s range during this time, the spell is lost. A modified memory does not neces-sarily affect the subject’s actions, particu-larly if it contradicts the creature’s natural inclinations. An illogical modified mem-ory, such as the subject recalling how much it enjoyed drinking poison, is dis-missed by the creature as a bad dream or a memory muddied by too much wine. More useful applications of modify memory include implanting memories of friendly encounters with you (inclining the subject to act favorably toward you), changing the details of orders given to the subject by a superior, or causing the subject to forget that it ever saw you or your party. The DM reserves the right to decide whether a modified memory is too nonsensical to significantly affect the subject. </p>

     <p>This spell grants you a powerful sixth sense in relation to yourself. Once during the spell’s duration, you may choose to use its effect. This spell grants you an insight bonus equal to your caster level (maximum +25) on any single attack roll, opposed ability or skill check, or saving throw. Alternatively, you can apply the insight bonus to your AC against a single attack (even if flat-footed). Activating the effect doesn’t take an action; you can even activate it on another character’s turn if needed. You must choose to use the moment of prescience before you make the roll it is to modify. Once used, the spell ends. You can’t have more than one moment of prescience active on you at the same time. </p>

     <p>All magical effects and magic items within the radius of the spell, except for those that you carry or touch, are disjoined. That is, spells and spell-like effects are separated into their individual components (ending the effect as a dispel magic spell does), and each permanent magic item must make a successful Will save or be turned into a normal item. An item in a creature’s possession uses its own Will save bonus or its possessor’s Will save bonus, whichever is higher. You also have a 1% chance per caster level of destroying an antimagic field. If the antimagic field survives the disjunction, no items within it are disjoined. Even artifacts are subject to disjunction, though there is only a 1% chance per caster level of actually affecting such powerful items. Additionally, if an artifact is des-troyed, you must make a DC 25 Will save or permanently lose all spellcasting abili-ties. (These abilities cannot be recovered by mortal magic, not even miracle or wish.) Note: Destroying artifacts is a dangerous business, and it is 95% likely to attract the attention of some powerful being who has an interest in or connection with the device. </p>

     <p>You conjure up a phantom watchdog that is invisible to everyone but yourself. It then guards the area where it was conjured (it does not move). The hound immediately starts barking loudly if any Small or larger creature approaches within 30 feet of it. (Those within 30 feet of the hound when it is conjured may move about in the area, but if they leave and re-turn, they activate the barking.) The hound sees invisible and ethereal creatures. It does not react to figments, but it does react to shadow illusions. If an intruder approaches to within 5 feet of the hound, the dog stops barking and delivers a vicious bite (+10 attack bo-nus, 2d6+3 points of piercing damage) once per round. The dog also gets the bo-nuses appropriate to an invisible creature. The dog is considered ready to bite intruders, so it delivers its first bite on the intruder’s turn. Its bite is the equivalent of a magic weapon for the purpose of damage reduction. The hound cannot be attacked, but it can be dispelled. The spell lasts for 1 hour per caster level, but once the hound begins barking, it lasts only 1 round per caster level. If you are ever more than 100 feet distant from the hound, the spell ends.</p>

     <p>You conjure up an extradimensional dwelling that has a single entrance on the plane from which the spell was cast. The entry point looks like a faint shimmering in the air that is 4 feet wide and 8 feet high. Only those you designate may enter the mansion, and the portal is shut and made invisible behind you when you enter. You may open it again from your own side at will. Once observers have passed beyond the entrance, they are in a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm. You can create any floor plan you desire to the limit of the spell’s effect. The place is furnished and contains sufficient food-stuffs to serve a nine-course banquet to a dozen people per caster level. A staff of near-transparent servants (as many as two per caster level), liveried and obedient, wait upon all who enter. The servants function as unseen servant spells except that they are visible and can go anywhere in the mansion. Since the place can be entered only through its special portal, outside condi-tions do not affect the mansion, nor do conditions inside it pass to the plane beyond.</p>

     <p>This spell ensures privacy. Anyone looking into the area from outside sees only a dark, foggy mass. Darkvision cannot penetrate it. No sounds, no matter how loud, can escape the area, so nobody can eavesdrop from outside. Those inside can see out normally. Divination (scrying) spells cannot per-ceive anything within the area, and those within are immune to detect thoughts. The ward prevents speech between those in-side and those outside (because it blocks sound), but it does not prevent other com-munication, such as a sending or message spell, or telepathic communication, such as that between a wizard and her familiar. The spell does not prevent creatures or objects from moving into and out of the area. Mordenkainen’s private sanctum can be made permanent with a permanency spell.</p>

     <p>This spell brings into being a shimmering, swordlike plane of force. The sword strikes at any opponent within its range, as you desire, starting in the round that you cast the spell. The sword attacks its designated target once each round on your turn. Its attack bonus is equal to your caster level + your Int bonus or your Cha bonus (for wizards or sorcerers, respectively) with an additional +3 enhancement bonus. As a force effect, it can strike ethereal and incorporeal creatures. It deals 4d6+3 points of force damage, with a threat range of 19–20 and a critical multiplier of ×2. The sword always strikes from your direction. It does not get a bonus for flanking or help a combatant get one. If the sword goes beyond the spell range from you, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the sword returns to you and hovers. Each round after the first, you can use a standard action to switch the sword to a new target. If you do not, the sword con-tinues to attack the previous round’s target. The sword cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation affects it. The sword’s AC is 13 (10, +0 size bonus for Medium object, +3 deflection bonus). If an attacked creature has spell resist-ance, the resistance is checked the first time Mordenkainen’s sword strikes it. If the sword is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the sword has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.</p>

     <p>Move earth moves dirt (clay, loam, sand), possibly collapsing embankments, moving hillocks, shifting dunes, and so forth. However, in no event can rock formations be collapsed or moved. The area to be affected determines the casting time. For every 150-foot square (up to 10 feet deep), casting takes 10 minutes. The maximum area, 750 feet by 750 feet, takes 4 hours and 10 minutes to move. This spell does not violently break the surface of the ground. Instead, it creates wavelike crests and troughs, with the earth reacting with glacierlike fluidity until the desired result is achieved. Trees, structures, rock formations, and such are mostly unaffected except for changes in elevation and relative topography. The spell cannot be used for tunneling and is generally too slow to trap or bury creatures. Its primary use is for digging or filling moats or for adjusting terrain con-tours before a battle. This spell has no effect on earth crea-tures.</p>

     <p>You detoxify any sort of venom in the creature or object touched. A poisoned creature suffers no additional effects from the poison, and any temporary effects are ended, but the spell does not reverse instantaneous effects, such as hit point damage, temporary ability damage, or effects that don’t go away on their own. For example, if a poison has dealt 3 points of Constitution damage to a character and threatens to deal more damage later, this spell prevents the future damage but does not repair the damage already done. The creature is immune to any poison it is exposed to during the duration of the spell. Unlike with delay poison, such effects aren’t postponed until after the duration —the creature need not make any saves against poison effects applied to it during the length of the spell. This spell can instead neutralize the poison in a poisonous creature or object for the duration of the spell, at the caster’s option. </p>

     <p>You send a hideous and unsettling phan-tasmal vision to a specific creature that you name or otherwise specifically designate. The nightmare prevents restful sleep and causes 1d10 points of damage. The night-mare leaves the subject fatigued and unable to regain arcane spells for the next 24 hours. The difficulty of the save depends on how well you know the subject and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to that creature. Knowledge Will Save Modifier None1 +10 Secondhand (you have heard of the subject) +5 Firsthand (you have met the subject) +0 Familiar (you know the subject well) –5 1 You must have some sort of connection to a creature you have no knowledge of. Connection Will Save Modifier Likeness or picture –2 Possession or garment –4 Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, etc. –10 Dispel evil cast on the subject while you are casting the spell dispels the nightmare and causes you to be stunned for 10 minutes per caster level of the dispel evil. If the recipient is awake when the spell begins, you can choose to cease casting (ending the spell) or to enter a trance until the recipient goes to sleep, whereupon you become alert again and complete the cast-ing. If you are disturbed during the trance, you must succeed on a Concentration check as if you were in the midst of casting a spell (see page 69) or the spell ends. If you choose to enter a trance, you are not aware of your surroundings or the activities around you while in the trance. You are defenseless, both physically and mentally, while in the trance. (You always fail any saving throw, for example.) Creatures who don’t sleep (such as elves, but not half-elves) or dream are immune to this spell. </p>

     <p>The warded creature or object becomes difficult to detect by divination spells such as clairaudience/clairvoyance, locate object, and detect spells. Nondetection also prevents location by such magic items as crystal balls. If a divination is attempted against the warded creature or item, the caster of the divination must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the spellcaster who cast nondetection. If you cast nondetection on yourself or on an item currently in your possession, the DC is 15 + your caster level. If cast on a creature, nondetection wards the creature’s gear as well as the creature itself.</p>

     <p>You alter an item’s aura so that it registers to detect spells (and spells with similar capabilities) as though it were nonmagical, or a magic item of a kind you specify, or the subject of a spell you specify. You could make an ordinary sword register as a +2 vorpal sword as far as magical detection is concerned or make a +2 vorpal sword register as if it were a +1 sword or even a nonmagical sword. If the object bearing Nystul’s magic aura has identify cast on it or is similarly exam-ined, the examiner recognizes that the aura is false and detects the object’s actual qualities if he succeeds on a Will save. Otherwise, he believes the aura and no amount of testing reveals what the true magic is. If the targeted item’s own aura is excep-tionally powerful (if it is an artifact, for instance), Nystul’s magic aura doesn’t work. Note: A magic weapon, shield, or suit of armor must be a masterwork item, so a sword of average make, for example, looks suspicious if it has a magical aura.</p>
     <p>Focus: A small square of silk that must be passed over the object that receives the aura. </p>

     <p>A misty vapor arises around you. It is sta-tionary once created. The vapor obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has conceal-ment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total conceal-ment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a gust of wind spell, disperses the fog in 4 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph) dis-perses the fog in 1 round. A fireball, flame strike, or similar spell burns away the fog in the explosive or fiery spell’s area. A wall of fire burns away the fog in the area into which it deals damage. This spell does not function underwater.</p>

If anything resists this activity (such as a bar on a door or a lock on a chest), the spell fails. In addition, the spell can only open and close things weighing 30 pounds or less. Thus, doors, chests, and similar objects sized for enormous creatures may be beyond this spell’s ability to affect.</p>

     <p>You channel lawful power to smite ene-mies. The power takes the form of a three-dimensional grid of energy. Only chaotic and neutral (not lawful) creatures are harmed by the spell. The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to chaotic creatures (or 1d6 points of damage per caster level, maximum 10d6, to chaotic outsiders) and causes them to be dazed for 1 round. A successful Will save reduces the damage to half and negates the daze effect. The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither chaotic nor lawful, and they are not dazed. They can reduce the damage in half again (down to one-quarter of the roll) with a successful Will save. </p>

     <p>Otiluke’s Freezing sphere creates a frigid globe of cold energy that streaks from your fingertips to the location you select, where it explodes in a 10-foot-radius burst, dealing 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) to each creature in the area. An elemental (water) creature instead takes 1d8 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d8). If the freezing sphere strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area equal to 100 square feet (a 10- foot square) per caster level (maximum 1,500 square feet). This ice lasts for 1 round per caster level. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water become trapped in the ice. Attempting to break free is a full-round action. A trapped creature must make a DC 25 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check to do so. You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish. Treat this as a touch spell for which you are holding the charge (see page 176). You can hold the charge for as long as 1 round per level, at the end of which time the freezing sphere bursts centered on you (and you receive no saving throw to resist its effect). Firing the globe in a later round is a standard action.</p>
     <p>Focus: A small crystal sphere. </p>

     <p>A globe of shimmering force encloses a creature, provided the creature is small enough to fit within the diameter of the sphere. The sphere contains its subject for the spell’s duration. The sphere is not subject to damage of any sort except from a rod of cancellation, a rod of negation, a dis-integrate spell, or a targeted dispel magic spell. These effects destroy the sphere without harm to the subject. Nothing can pass through the sphere, inside or out, though the subject can breathe normally. The subject may struggle, but the sphere cannot be physically moved either by people outside it or by the struggles of those within.</p>

     <p><sup><strong>Сопротивление магии:</strong> Yes (object) </sup></p>
     <p>This spell functions like Otiluke’s resilient sphere, with the addition that the creatures or objects inside the globe are nearly weightless. Anything contained within an Otiluke’s telekinetic sphere weighs only one-sixteenth of its normal weight. You can telekinetically lift anything in the sphere that normally weighs 5,000 pounds or less. The telekinetic control extends from you out to medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per caster level) after the sphere has succeeded in encapsulating its contents. You can move objects or creatures in the sphere that weigh a total of 5,000 pounds or less by concentrating on the sphere. You can begin moving a sphere in the round after casting the spell. If you concentrate on doing so (a standard action), you can move the sphere as much as 30 feet in a round. If you cease concentrating, the sphere does not move in that round (if on a level surface) or descends at its falling rate (if aloft) until it reaches a level surface, or the spell’s duration expires, or you begin concentrating again. If you cease concen-trating (voluntarily or due to failing a Con-centration check), you can resume concen-trating on your next turn or any later turn during the spell’s duration. The sphere falls at a rate of only 60 feet per round, which is not fast enough to cause damage to the contents of the sphere. You can move the sphere telekinetically even if you are in it.</p>

     <p>The subject feels an undeniable urge to dance and begins doing so, complete with foot shuffling and tapping. The spell effect makes it impossible for the subject to do anything other than caper and prance in place. The effect imposes a –4 penalty to Armor Class and a –10 penalty on Reflex saves, and it negates any AC bonus granted by a shield the target holds. The dancing subject provokes attacks of opportunity each round on its turn. </p>

     <p>You create a passage through wooden, plas-ter, or stone walls, but not through metal or other harder materials. The passage is 10 feet deep plus an additional 5 feet deep per three caster levels above 9th (15 feet at 12th, 20 feet at 15th, and a maximum of 25 feet deep at 18th level). If the wall’s thick-ness is more than the depth of the passage created, then a single passwall simply makes a niche or short tunnel. Several passwall spells can then form a continuing passage to breach very thick walls. When passwall ends, creatures within the passage are ejected out the nearest exit. If someone dispels the passwall or you dismiss it, crea-tures in the passage are ejected out the far exit, if there is one, or out the sole exit if there is only one.</p>

     <p>You create a phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable to the subject simply by forming the fears of the subject’s subconscious mind into some-thing that its conscious mind can visualize: this most horrible beast. Only the spell’s subject can see the phantasmal killer. You see only a vague shape. The target first gets a Will save to recognize the image as unreal. If that save fails, the phantasm touches the subject, and the subject must succeed on a Fortitude save or die from fear. Even if the Fortitude save is successful, the subject takes 3d6 points of damage. If the subject of a phantasmal killer attack succeeds in disbelieving and is wearing a helm of telepathy, the beast can be turned upon you. You must then disbelieve it or become subject to its deadly fear attack. </p>

     <p>You conjure a Large, quasi-real, horselike creature. The steed can be ridden only by you or by the one person for whom you specifically created the mount. A phantom steed has a black head and body, gray mane and tail, and smoke-colored, insubstantial hooves that make no sound. It has what seems to be a saddle, bit, and bridle. It does not fight, but animals shun it and refuse to attack it. The mount has an AC of 18 (–1 size, +4 natural armor, +5 Dex) and 7 hit points +1 hit point per caster level. If it loses all its hit points, the phantom steed disappears. A phantom steed has a speed of 20 feet per caster level, to a maximum of 240 feet. It can bear its rider’s weight plus up to 10 pounds per caster level. These mounts gain certain powers ac-cording to caster level. A mount’s abilities include those of mounts of lower caster levels. Thus, a mount created by a 12th-level caster has the 8th, 10th, and 12th caster level abilities. 8th Level: The mount can ride over sandy, muddy, or even swampy ground without difficulty or decrease in speed. 10th Level: The mount can use water walk at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this ability). 12th Level: The mount can use air walk at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this ability) for up to 1 round at a time, after which it falls to the ground. 14th Level: The mount can fly at its speed (average maneuverability). </p>

     <p>This spell creates an ethereal passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not other materials. The phase door is invisible and inaccessible to all creatures except you, and only you can use the passage. You disappear when you enter the phase door and appear when you exit. If you desire, you can take one other creature (Medium or smaller) through the door. This counts as two uses of the door. The door does not allow light, sound, or spell effects through it, nor can you see through it without using it. Thus, the spell can provide an escape route, though certain creatures, such as phase spiders, can follow with ease. A gem of true seeing or similar magic reveals the presence of a phase door but does not allow its use. A phase door is subject to dispel magic. If anyone is within the passage when it is dispelled, he is harmlessly ejected just as if he were inside a passwall effect. You can allow other creatures to use the phase door by setting some triggering con-dition for the door. Such conditions can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. They can be based on a creature’s name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intan-gibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don’t qualify. Phase door can be made permanent with a permanency spell. </p>

     <p>By casting this spell, you request your deity to send you an elemental or outsider (of 6 HD or less) of the deity’s choice. If you serve no particular deity, the spell is a general plea answered by a creature shar-ing your philosophical alignment. If you know an individual creature’s name, you may request that individual by speaking the name during the spell (though you might get a different creature anyway). You may ask the creature to perform one task in exchange for a payment from you. Tasks might range from the simple (fly us across the chasm, help us fight a battle) to the complex (spy on our enemies, protect us on our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature called in order to bargain for its services. The creature called requires a payment for its services. This payment can take a variety of forms, from donating gold or magic items to an allied temple, to a gift given directly to the creature, to some other action on your part that matches the creature’s alignment and goals. Regardless, this payment must be made before the creature agrees to perform any services. The bargaining takes at least 1 round, so any actions by the creature begin in the round after it arrives. A task taking up to 1 minute per caster level requires a payment of 100 gp per HD of the creature called. For a task taking up to 1 hour per caster level, the creature requires a payment of 500 gp per HD. A long-term task, one requiring up to one day per caster level, requires a payment of 1,000 gp per HD. A nonhazardous task requires only half the indicated payment, while an especially hazardous task might require a greater gift. Few if any creatures will accept a task that seems suicidal (remember, a called creature actually dies when it is killed, unlike a summoned creature). However, if the task is strongly aligned with the crea-ture’s ethos, the DM may halve or even waive the payment. For instance, a celestial creature called to battle demons might require a gift of only half the normal value. At the end of its task, or when the dura-tion bargained for expires, the creature returns to its home plane (after reporting back to you, if appropriate and possible). Note: When you use a calling spell that calls an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type. For example, a lesser planar ally is a fire spell when it calls a fire elemental. </p>

     <p>Casting this spell attempts a dangerous act: to lure a creature from another plane to a specifically prepared trap, which must lie within the spell’s range. The called creature is held in the trap until it agrees to perform one service in return for its freedom. To create the trap, you must use a magic circle spell, focused inward. The kind of creature to be bound must be known and stated. If you wish to call a specific indi-vidual, you must use that individual’s proper name in casting the spell. The target creature is allowed a Will saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature resists the spell. If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the trap (spell resistance does not keep it from being called). The creature can escape from the trap with by successfully pitting its spell resistance against your caster level check, by dimen-sional travel, or with a successful Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/2 your caster level + your Cha modifier). It can try each method once per day. If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you. A dimensional anchor cast on the creature prevents its escape via dimen-sional travel. You can also employ a calling diagram (see magic circle against evil, page 246) to make the trap more secure. If the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare. You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward. You make a Charisma check opposed by the creature’s Charisma check. The DM assigns your check a bonus of +0 to +6 based on the nature of the service and the reward. If the creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours. This process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to. If you roll a 1 on the Charisma check, the creature breaks free of the binding and can escape or attack you. Once the requested service is com-pleted, the creature need only so inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came. The creature might later seek re-venge. If you assign some open-ended task that the creature cannot complete though its own actions (such as “Wait here” or “Defend this area against attack”), the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level, and the creature gains an immediate chance to break free. Note that a clever recipient can subvert some instructions. When you use a calling spell to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type. For example, lesser planar binding is a water spell when you cast it to call a water ele-mental. </p>

From the Material Plane, you can reach any other plane, though you appear 5 to 500 miles (5d%) from your intended destination. Note: Plane shift transports creatures in-stantaneously and then ends.

     <p>Plant growth has different effects depend-ing on the version chosen. Overgrowth: This effect causes normal vegetation (grasses, briars, bushes, creep-ers, thistles, trees, vines) within long range (400 feet + 40 feet per caster level) to become thick and overgrown. The plants entwine to form a thicket or jungle that creatures must hack or force a way through. Speed drops to 5 feet, or 10 feet for Large or larger creatures. (The DM may allow faster movement for very small or very large creatures.) The area must have brush and trees in it for this spell to take effect. At your option, the area can be a 100-foot-radius circle, a 150-foot-radius semi-circle, or a 200-foot-radius quarter circle. You may designate places within the area that are not affected. Enrichment: This effect targets plants within a range of one-half mile, raising their potential productivity over the course of the next year to one-third above normal. Plant growth counters diminish plants. This spell has no effect on plant crea-tures. </p>

     <p>This spell functions like alter self, except that you change the willing subject into another form of living creature. The new form may be of the same type as the sub-ject or any of the following types: aber-ration, animal, dragon, fey, giant, humanoid, magical beast, monstrous hu-manoid, ooze, plant, or vermin. The as-sumed form can’t have more Hit Dice than your caster level (or the subject’s HD, whichever is lower), to a maximum of 15 HD at 15th level. You can’t cause a subject to assume a form smaller than Fine, nor can you cause a subject to assume an incorporeal or gaseous form. The subject’s creature type and subtype (if any) change to match the new form (see the Monster Manual for more information). Upon changing, the subject regains lost hit points as if it had rested for a night (though this healing does not restore tem-porary ability damage and provide other benefits of resting; and changing back does not heal the subject further). If slain, the subject reverts to its original form, though it remains dead. The subject gains the Strength, Dex-terity, and Constitution scores of the new form but retains its own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. It also gains all extraordinary special attacks possessed by the form (such as constrict, improved grab, and poison) but does not gain the extraordinary special qualities possessed by the new form (such as blindsense, fast healing, regeneration, and scent) or any supernatural or spell-like abilities. Incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to being polymorphed, and a crea-ture with the shapechanger subtype (such as a lycanthrope or a doppelganger) can revert to its natural form as a standard action.</p>

     <p>This spell functions like polymorph, except that it changes one object or creature into another. The duration of the spell depends on how radical a change is made from the original state to its enchanted state. The DM determines the duration by using the following guidelines. Increase to Changed Subject Is: Duration Factor1 Same kingdom (animal, +5 vegetable, mineral) Same class (mammals, +2 fungi, metals, etc.) Same size +2 Related (twig is to tree, +2 wolf fur is to wolf, etc.) Same or lower Intelligence +2 1 Add all that apply. Look up the total on the next table. Duration Factor Duration Example 0 20 minutes Pebble to human 2 1 hour Marionette to human 4 3 hours Human to marionette 5 12 hours Lizard to manticore 6 2 days Sheep to wool coat 7 1 week Shrew to manticore 9+ Permanent Manticore to shrew Unlike polymorph, polymorph any object does grant the creature the Intelligence score of its new form. If the original form didn’t have a Wisdom or Charisma score, it gains those scores as appropriate for the new form. Damage taken by the new form can result in the injury or death of the poly-morphed creature. For example, it is pos-sible to polymorph a creature into rock and then grind it to dust, causing damage, perhaps even death. If the creature was changed to dust to start with, more creative methods to damage it would be needed. Perhaps you could use a gust of wind spell to scatter the dust far and wide. In general, damage occurs when the new form is changed through physical force, although the DM must adjudicate many of these situations. A nonmagical object cannot be made into a magic item with this spell. Magic items aren’t affected by this spell. This spell cannot create material of great intrinsic value, such as copper, silver, gems, silk, gold, platinum, mithral, or adamantine. It also cannot reproduce the special properties of cold iron in order to overcome the damage reduction of certain creatures. This spell can also be used to duplicate the effects of polymorph, flesh to stone, stone to flesh, transmute mud to rock, transmute water to dust, or transmute rock to mud. </p>

     <p>Prestidigitations are minor tricks that novice spellcasters use for practice. Once cast, a prestidigitation spell enables you to perform simple magical effects for 1 hour. The effects are minor and have severe lim-itations. A prestidigitation can slowly lift 1 pound of material. It can color, clean, or soil items in a 1-foot cube each round. It can chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of non-living material. It cannot deal damage or affect the concentration of spellcasters. Prestidigitation can create small objects, but they look crude and artificial. The materials created by a prestidigitation spell are extremely fragile, and they cannot be used as tools, weapons, or spell compo-nents. Finally, a prestidigitation lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects. Any actual change to an object (beyond just moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists only 1 hour. Characters typically use prestidigitation spells to impress common folk, amuse children, and brighten dreary lives. Com-mon tricks with prestidigitations include producing tinklings of ethereal music, brightening faded flowers, creating glow-ing balls that float over your hand, gener-ating puffs of wind to flicker candles, spicing up aromas and flavors of bland food, and making little whirlwinds to sweep dust under rugs. </p>

The sphere flashes in all colors of the visible spectrum. The sphere’s blindness effect on creatures with less than 8 HD lasts 2d4×10 minutes. You can pass into and out of the pris-matic sphere and remain near it without harm. However, when you’re inside it, the sphere blocks any attempt to project something through the sphere (including spells). Other creatures that attempt to attack you or pass through suffer the effects of each color, one at a time. Typically, only the upper hemisphere of the globe will exist, since you are at the center of the sphere, so the lower half is usually excluded by the floor surface you are standing on. The colors of the sphere have the same effects as the colors of a prismatic wall. Prismatic sphere can be made permanent with a permanency spell. </p>

     <p>Prismatic wall creates a vertical, opaque wall—a shimmering, multicolored plane of light that protects you from all forms of attack. The wall flashes with seven colors, each of which has a distinct power and purpose. The wall is immobile, and you can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. However, any other creature with less than 8 HD that is within 20 feet of the wall is blinded for 2d4 rounds by the colors if it looks at the wall. The wall’s maximum proportions are 4 feet wide per caster level and 2 feet high per caster level. A prismatic wall spell cast to materialize in a space occupied by a creature is disrupted, and the spell is wasted. Each color in the wall has a special effect. The accompanying table shows the seven colors of the wall, the order in which they appear, their effects on creatures trying to attack you or pass through the wall, and the magic needed to negate each color. The wall can be destroyed, color by color, in consecutive order, by various magical effects; however, the first color must be brought down before the second can be affected, and so on. A rod of cancel-lation or a Mordenkainen’s disjunction spell destroys a prismatic wall, but an antimagic field fails to penetrate it. Dispel magic and greater dispel magic cannot dispel the wall or anything beyond it. Spell resistance is effective against a prismatic wall, but the caster level check must be repeated for each color present. Prismatic wall can be made permanent with a permanency spell. </p>

     <p>Flames as bright as a torch appear in your open hand. The flames harm neither you nor your equipment. In addition to providing illumination, the flames can be hurled or used to touch enemies. You can strike an opponent with a melee touch attack, dealing fire damage equal to 1d6 +1 point per caster level (maximum +5). Alternatively, you can hurl the flames up to 120 feet as a thrown weapon. When doing so, you attack with a ranged touch attack (with no range penalty) and deal the same damage as with the melee attack. No sooner do you hurl the flames than a new set appears in your hand. Each attack you make reduces the remaining duration by 1 minute. If an attack reduces the remaining duration to 0 minutes or less, the spell ends after the attack resolves. This spell does not function underwater. </p>

Martin You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were standing where it is, and during your turn you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again, as a free action. While you are using its senses, your body is con-sidered blinded and deafened. If you desire, any spell you cast whose range is touch or greater can originate from the projected image instead of from you. The projected image can’t cast any spells on itself except for illusion spells. The spells affect other targets normally, despite originating from the projected image. Objects are affected by the projected image as if they had succeeded on their Will save. You must maintain line of effect to the projected image at all times. If your line of effect is obstructed, the spell ends. If you use dimension door, teleport, plane shift, or a similar spell that breaks your line of effect, even momentarily, the spell ends.</p>

     <p>This spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from mental control, and from summoned creatures. It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects. First, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures. Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a magic jar attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature (include-ing enchantment (charm) effects and enchantment (compulsion) effects that grant the caster ongoing control over the subject, such as dominate person). The pro-tection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the protection from evil effect. If the protec-tion from evil effect ends before the effect granting mental control does, the would-be controller would then be able to men-tally command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possess-ing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast. This second effect works regardless of align-ment. Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded crea-ture. Good summoned creatures are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Spell resist-ance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature. </p>
     <p>Arcane Material Component: A little pow-dered silver with which you trace a 3-foot -diameter circle on the floor (or ground) around the creature to be warded. </p>

     <p>You create a number of semitangible, visi-ble magical orbs (called “eyes”) equal to 1d4 + your caster level. These eyes move out, scout around, and return as you direct them when casting the spell. Each eye can see 120 feet (normal vision only) in all directions. While the individual eyes are quite fragile, they’re small and difficult to spot. Each eye is a Fine construct, about the size of a small apple, that has 1 hit point, AC 18 (+8 bonus for its size), flies at a speed of 30 feet with perfect maneuverability, and has a +16 Hide modifier. It has a Spot modifier equal to your caster level (maximum +15) and is subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and any other factors that would affect your ability to receive visual information about your surroundings. An eye traveling through darkness must find its way by touch. When you create the eyes, you specify instructions you want them to follow in a command of no more than twenty-five words. Any knowledge you possess is known by the eyes as well, so if you know, for example, what a typical merchant looks like, the eyes do as well. A sample command: “Surround me at a range of four hundred feet and return if you spot any dangerous creatures.” The phrase “Surround me” directs the eyes to form an equally spaced, horizontal ring at whatever range you indicate, and then move with you. As eyes return or are destroyed, the rest automatically space themselves to compensate. In the case of this sample command, an eye returns only if it spots a creature you would regard as dangerous. A “peasant” that is actually a shapechanged dragon wouldn’t trigger an eye’s return. Ten eyes can form a ring with a radius of 400 feet and between them-selves see everything that crosses the ring. Another sample command: “Spread out and search the town for Arweth. Follow him for three minutes, staying out of sight, and then return.” The phrase “Spread out” directs the eyes to move away from you in all directions. In this case, each eye would separately follow Arweth for three minutes once it spots him. Other commands that might be useful include having eyes form a line in a certain manner, making them move at random within a certain range, or having them follow a certain type of creature. The DM is the final judge of the suitability of your directions. In order to report their findings, the eyes must return to your hand. Each re-plays in your mind all it has seen during its existence. It takes an eye 1 round to replay 1 hour of recorded images. After relaying its findings, an eye disappears. If an eye ever gets more than 1 mile away from you, it instantly ceases to exist. However, your link with the eye is such that you won’t know if the eye was de-stroyed because it wandered out of range or because of some other event. The eyes exist for up to 1 hour per caster level or until they return to you. Dispel magic can destroy eyes. Roll separately for each eye caught in an area dispel. Of course, if an eye is sent into darkness, it could hit a wall or similar obstacle and destroy itself.</p>

     <p>Pyrotechnics turns a fire into either a burst of blinding fireworks or a thick cloud of choking smoke, depending on the version you choose. Fireworks: The fireworks are a flashing, fiery, momentary burst of glowing, colored aerial lights. This effect causes creatures within 120 feet of the fire source to become blinded for 1d4+1 rounds (Will negates). These creatures must have line of sight to the fire to be affected. Spell resistance can prevent blindness. Smoke Cloud: A writhing stream of smoke billows out from the source, form-ing a choking cloud. The cloud spreads 20 feet in all directions and lasts for 1 round per caster level. All sight, even darkvision, is ineffective in or through the cloud. All within the cloud take –4 penalties to Strength and Dexterity (Fortitude negates). These effects last for 1d4+1 rounds after the cloud dissipates or after the creature leaves the area of the cloud. Spell resistance does not apply.</p>
     <p>Material Component: The spell uses one fire source, which is immediately extin-guished. A fire so large that it exceeds a 20-foot cube is only partly extinguished. Magical fires are not extinguished, al-though a fire-based creature (such as a fire elemental) used as a source takes 1 point of damage per caster level. </p>

     <p>Quench is often used to put out forest fires and other conflagrations. It extinguishes all nonmagical fires in its area. The spell also dispels any fire spells in its area, though you must succeed on a dispel check (1d20 +1 per caster level, maximum +15) against each spell to dispel it. The DC to dispel such spells is 11 + the caster level of the fire spell. Each elemental (fire) creature within the area of a quench spell takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6, no save allowed). Alternatively, you can target the spell on a single magic item that creates or controls flame, such as a wand of fireball or a flaming burst sword. The item loses all its fire-based magical abilities for 1d4 hours unless it succeeds on a Will save. (Artifacts are immune to this effect.) </p>

     <p>A glowing, rainbow-hued pattern of in-terweaving colors fascinates those within it. Rainbow pattern fascinates a maximum of 24 Hit Dice of creatures. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell’s point of origin are affected first. An affected creature that fails its saves is fascinated by the pattern. With a simple gesture (a free action), you can make the rainbow pattern move up to 30 feet per round (moving its effect-tive point of origin). All fascinated crea-tures follow the moving rainbow of light, trying to get or remain within the effect. Fascinated creatures who are restrained and removed from the pattern still try to follow it. If the pattern leads its subjects into a dangerous area (through flame, off a cliff, or the like), each fascinated creature gets a second save. If the view of the lights is completely blocked (by an obscuring mist spell, for instance), creatures who can’t see them are no longer affected. The spell does not affect sightless crea-tures. Verbal Component: A wizard or sorcerer need not utter a sound to cast this spell, but a bard must sing, play music, or recite a rhyme as a verbal component.</p>

     <p>You restore life to a deceased creature. You can raise a creature that has been dead for no longer than one day per caster level. In addition, the subject’s soul must be free and willing to return (see Bringing Back the Dead, page 171). If the subject’s soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw. Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The subject of the spell loses one level (or 1 Hit Die) when it is raised, just as if it had lost a level or a Hit Die to an energy-draining creature. If the subject is 1st level, it loses 2 points of Constitution instead (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can’t be raised). This level/HD loss or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any means. A character who died with spells prepared has a 50% chance of losing any given spell upon being raised, in addition to losing spells for losing a level. A spellcasting creature that doesn’t prepare spells (such as a sorcerer) has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell, in addition to losing spell slots for losing a level. A raised creature has a number of hit points equal to its current Hit Dice. Any ability scores damaged to 0 are raised to 1. Normal poison and normal disease are cured in the process of raising the subject, but magical diseases and curses are not undone. While the spell closes mortal wounds and repairs lethal damage of most kinds, the body of the creature to be raised must be whole. Otherwise, missing parts are still missing when the creature is brought back to life. None of the dead creature’s equipment or possessions are affected in any way by this spell. A creature who has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can’t be raised by this spell. Constructs, ele-mentals, outsiders, and undead creatures can’t be raised. The spell cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age.</p>

Prepare: You prepare up to three addi-tional levels of spells (such as three 1st-level spells, a 2nd- and a 1st-level spell, or a 3rd-level spell). A cantrip counts as 1/2 level for this purpose. You prepare and cast these spells normally. Retain: You retain any spell of 3rd level or lower that you had cast up to 1 round before you started casting the mnemonic enhancer.

Each creature in-cluded in the link is linked to all the others. The creatures can communicate telepathically through the bond regardless of language. No special power or influence is established as a result of the bond. Once the bond is formed, it works over any distance (although not from one plane to another). If desired, you may leave yourself out of the telepathic bond forged. This decision must be made at the time of casting.

     <p>This spell causes instant diminution of a humanoid creature, halving its height, length, and width and dividing its weight by 8. This decrease changes the creature’s size category to the next smaller one. The target gains a +2 size bonus to Dexterity, a –2 size penalty to Strength (to a minimum of 1), and a +1 bonus on attack rolls and AC due to its reduced size. A Small humanoid creature whose size decreases to Tiny has a space of 2-1/2 feet and a natural reach of 0 feet (meaning that it must enter an opponent’s square to attack). A Large humanoid creature whose size decreases to Medium has a space of 5 feet and a natural reach of 5 feet. This spell doesn’t change the target’s speed. All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly reduced by the spell. Melee and projectile weapons deal less damage (see Table 2–3 in the Dungeon Master’s Guide). Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any reduced item that leaves the reduced creature’s pos-session (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage (projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them). Multiple magical effects that reduce size do not stack, which means (among other things) that you can’t use a second casting of this spell to further reduce the size of as humanoid that’s still under the effect of the first casting. Reduce person counters and dispels en-large person. Reduce person can be made permanent with a permanency spell.</p>

     <p>You create powerful magic in some spe-cially prepared object—a statuette, a jew-eled rod, a gem, or the like. This object contains the power to instantly transport its possessor across any distance within the same plane to your abode. Once the item is transmuted, you must give it willingly to a creature and at the same time inform it of a command word to be spoken when the item is used. To make use of the item, the subject speaks the command word at the same time that it rends or breaks the item (a standard action). When this is done, the individual and all objects it is wearing and carrying (to a maximum of the character’s heavy load) are instantly transported to your abode. No other creatures are affected (aside from a familiar that is touching the subject). You can alter the spell when casting it so that it transports you to within 10 feet of the possessor of the item when it is broken and the command word spoken. You will have a general idea of the location and situation of the item possessor at the time the refuge spell is discharged, but once you decide to alter the spell in this fashion, you have no choice whether or not to be transported.</p>
     <p>Material Component: The specially pre-pared object, whose construction requires gems worth 1,500 gp. </p>

     <p>With this spell, you bring back a dead creature in another body, provided that its death occurred no more than one week before the casting of the spell and the sub-ject’s soul is free and willing to return (see Bringing Back the Dead, page 171). If the subject’s soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw. Since the dead creature is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small por-tion of the creature’s body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature’s body at the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes 1 hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is rein-carnated. A reincarnated creature recalls the majority of its former life and form. It re-tains any class abilities, feats, or skill ranks it formerly possessed. Its class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points are unchanged. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores depend partly on the new body. First eliminate the subject’s racial adjustments (since it is no longer of his previous race) and then apply the adjustments found below to its remaining ability scores. The subject’s level (or Hit Dice) is reduced by 1. If the subject was 1st level, its new Constitution score is reduced by 2. (If this reduction would put its Con at 0 or lower, it can’t be reincarnated). This level/HD loss or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any means. It’s possible for the change in the sub-ject’s ability scores to make it difficult for it to pursue its previous character class. If this is the case, the subject is well advised to become a multiclass character. For a humanoid creature, the new in-carnation is determined using the follow-ing table. For nonhumanoid creatures, the DM should create a similar table of creatures of the same type or simply choose the new form. A creature that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can’t be returned to life by this spell. Con-structs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can’t be reincarnated. The spell cannot bring back a creature who has died of old age. d% Incarnation Str Dex Con 01 Bugbear +4 +2 +2 02–13 Dwarf +0 +0 +2 14–25 Elf +0 +2 –2 26 Gnoll +4 +0 +2 27–38 Gnome –2 +0 +2 39–42 Goblin –2 +2 +0 43–52 Half-elf +0 +0 +0 53–62 Half-orc +2 +0 +0 63–74 Halfling –2 +2 +0 75–89 Human +0 +0 +0 90–93 Kobold –4 +2 –2 94 Lizardfolk +2 +0 +2 95–98 Orc +4 +0 +0 99 Troglodyte +0 –2 +4 100 Other ? ? ?

All metal or stone objects in the path of the spell are pushed away from you to the limit of the range. Fixed metal or stone objects larger than 3 inches in diameter and loose objects weighing more than 500 pounds are not affected. Anything else, including animated objects, small boulders, and creatures in metal armor, moves back. Fixed objects 3 inches in diameter or smaller bend or break, and the pieces move with the wave of energy. Objects affected by the spell are repelled at the rate of 40 feet per round. Objects such as metal armor, swords, and the like are pushed back, dragging their bearers with them. Even magic items with metal components are repelled, although an antimagic field blocks the effects. The waves of energy continue to sweep down the set path for the spell’s duration. After you cast the spell, the path is set, and you can then do other things or go elsewhere without affecting the spell’s power. </p>

     <p>Waves of energy roll forth from you, mov-ing in the direction that you determine, causing all wooden objects in the path of the spell to be pushed away from you to the limit of the range. Wooden objects larger than 3 inches in diameter that are fixed firmly are not affected, but loose objects are. Objects 3 inches in diameter or smaller that are fixed in place splinter and break, and the pieces move with the wave of energy. Objects affected by the spell are repelled at the rate of 40 feet per round. Objects such as wooden shields, spears, wooden weapon shafts and hafts, and arrows and bolts are pushed back, dragging those carrying them along. (A creature being dragged by an item it is carrying can let go. A creature being dragged by a shield can loose it as a move action and drop it as a free action.)

Any creature within or entering the field must attempt a save. If it fails, it becomes unable to move toward you for the duration of the spell. Repelled crea-tures’ actions are not otherwise restricted. They can fight other creatures and can cast spells and attack you with ranged weapons. If you move closer to an affected creature, nothing happens. (The creature is not forced back.) The creature is free to make melee attacks against you if you come within reach.

     <p>This abjuration grants a creature limited protection from damage of whichever one of five energy types you select: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. The subject gains energy resistance 10 against the energy type chosen, meaning that each time the creature is subjected to such damage (whether from a natural or magical source), that damage is reduced by 10 points before being applied to the crea-ture’s hit points. The value of the energy resistance granted increases to 20 points at 7th level and to a maximum of 30 points at 11th level. The spell protects the recipient’s equipment as well. Resist energy absorbs only damage. The subject could still suffer unfortunate side effects, such as drowning in acid (since drowning damage comes from lack of oxygen) or becoming encased in ice. Note: Resist energy overlaps (and does not stack with) protection from energy. If a character is warded by protection from energy and resist energy, the protection spell absorbs damage until its power is exhausted. </p>

     <p>This spell functions like lesser restoration, except that it also dispels negative levels and restores one experience level to a creature who has had a level drained. The drained level is restored only if the time since the creature lost the level is equal to or less than one day per caster level. Thus, if a 10th-level character has been struck by a wight and drained to 9th level, restoration brings the character up to exactly the minimum number of experience points necessary to restore him to 10th level (45,000 XP), gaining him an additional Hit Die and level functions accordingly. Restoration cures all temporary ability damage, and it restores all points perma-nently drained from a single ability score (your choice if more than one is drained). It also eliminates any fatigue or exhaustion suffered by the target. Restoration does not restore levels or Constitution points lost due to death.</p>

     <p>This spell functions like raise dead, except that you are able to restore life and com-plete strength to any deceased creature. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature’s body still exists, it can be resurrected, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature’s body at the time of death. (The remains of a creature hit by a disintegrate spell count as a small portion of its body.) The creature can have been dead no longer than 10 years per caster level. Upon completion of the spell, the creature is immediately restored to full hit points, vigor, and health, with no loss of prepared spells. However, the subject loses one level, or 2 points of Constitution if the subject was 1st level. (If this reduction would bring its Con to 0 or lower, it can’t be resurrected). This level loss or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any means. You can resurrect someone killed by a death effect or someone who has been turned into an undead creature and then destroyed. You cannot resurrect someone who has died of old age. Constructs, ele-mentals, outsiders, and undead creatures can’t be resurrected.</p>

     <p>This spell reverses gravity in an area, caus-ing all unattached objects and creatures within that area to fall upward and reach the top of the area in 1 round. If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it in the same manner as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, until the spell ends. At the end of the spell duration, affected objects and creatures fall downward. Provided it has something to hold onto, a creature caught in the area can attempt a Reflex save to secure itself when the spell strikes. Creatures who can fly or levitate can keep themselves from falling. </p>

     <p>Your height immediately doubles, and your weight increases by a factor of eight. This increase changes your size category to the next larger one, and you gain a +8 size bonus to Strength and a +4 size bonus to Constitution. You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to your natural armor. You gain damage reduction 5/evil (if you normally channel positive energy) or damage reduction 5/good (if you normally channel negative energy). At 12th level this damage reduction becomes 10/evil or 10/good, and at 15th level it becomes 15/evil or 15/good (the maximum). Your size modifier for AC and attacks changes as appropriate to your new size category (if your original size was Diminutive, Tiny, Small, Medium, or Large, the modifier decreases by 1; other-wise see Size Modifier, page 134). Use Table 8–4: Creature Size and Scale to determine your new space and reach. This spell doesn’t change your speed. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, you attain the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using your increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If you fail, you are constrained without harm by the materials enclosing you—the spell cannot crush you by increasing your size. All equipment you wear or carry is similarly enlarged by the spell. Melee and projectile weapons deal more damage (see Table 2–2 in the Dungeon Master’s Guide). Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any enlarged item that leaves your possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage (projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them). Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack, which means (among other things) that you can’t use a second casting of this spell to further increase your size while you are still under the effect of the first casting. </p>

     <p>When this spell is cast upon a piece of rope from 5 to 30 feet long, one end of the rope rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to the ground, as if affixed at the upper end. The upper end is, in fact, fastened to an extradimensional space that is outside the multiverse of extradimensional spaces (“planes”). Crea-tures in the extradimensional space are hidden, beyond the reach of spells (including divinations), unless those spells work across planes. The space holds as many as eight creatures (of any size). Creatures in the space can pull the rope up into the space, making the rope “disap-pear.” In that case, the rope counts as one of the eight creatures that can fit in the space. The rope can support up to 16,000 pounds. A weight greater than that can pull the rope free. Spells cannot be cast across the extra-dimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the extradimensional space can see out of it as if a 3-foot-by- 5-foot window were centered on the rope. The window is present on the Material Plane, but it’s invisible, and even creatures that can see the window can’t see through it. Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends. The rope can be climbed by only one person at a time. The rope trick spell enables climbers to reach a normal place if they do not climb all the way to the extradimensional space. Note: It is hazardous to create an ex-tradimensional space within an existing extradimensional space or to take an ex-tradimensional space into an existing one.</p>

     <p>Any iron or iron alloy item you touch be-comes instantaneously rusted, pitted, and worthless, effectively destroyed. If the item is so large that it cannot fit within a 3-foot radius (a large iron door or a wall of iron), a 3-foot-radius volume of the metal is rusted and destroyed. Magic items made of metal are immune to this spell. You may employ rusting grasp in combat with a successful melee touch attack. Rusting grasp used in this way instanta-neously destroys 1d6 points of Armor Class gained from metal armor (to the maximum amount of protection the armor offered) through corrosion. For example, full plate armor (AC +8) could be reduced to +7 or as low as +2 in protection, depending on the die roll. Weapons in use by an opponent tar-geted by the spell are more difficult to grasp. You must succeed on a melee touch attack against the weapon. A metal weapon that is hit is destroyed. Note: Striking at an opponent’s weapon provokes an attack of opportunity. Also, you must touch the weapon and not the other way around. Against a ferrous creature, rusting grasp instantaneously deals 3d6 points of dam-age +1 per caster level (maximum +15) per successful attack. The spell lasts for 1 round per level, and you can make one melee touch attack per round. </p>

     <p>Any opponent attempting to strike or oth-erwise directly attack the warded creature, even with a targeted spell, must attempt a Will save. If the save succeeds, the opponent can attack normally and is unaffected by that casting of the spell. If the save fails, the opponent can’t follow through with the attack, that part of its action is lost, and it can’t directly attack the warded creature for the duration of the spell. Those not attempting to attack the subject remain unaffected. This spell does not prevent the warded creature from being attacked or affected by area or effect spells. The subject cannot attack without breaking the spell but may use nonattack spells or otherwise act. This allows a warded cleric to heal wounds, for example, or to cast a bless spell, perform an augury, summon creatures, and so on. </p>

     <p>This spell combines several elements to create a powerful protection from scrying and direct observation. When casting the spell, you dictate what will and will not be observed in the spell’s area. The illusion created must be stated in general terms. Thus, you could specify the illusion of yourself and another character playing chess for the duration of the spell, but you could not have the illusory chess players take a break, make dinner, and then resume their game. You could have a crossroads appear quiet and empty even while an army is actually passing through the area. You could specify that no one be seen (including passing strangers), that your troops be undetected, or even that every fifth person or unit should be visible. Once the conditions are set, they cannot be changed. Attempts to scry the area automatically detect the image stated by you with no save allowed. Sight and sound are appro-priate to the illusion created. A band of people standing in a meadow could be concealed as an empty meadow with birds chirping, for instance. Direct observation may allow a save (as per a normal illusion), if there is cause to disbelieve what is seen. Certainly onlook-ers in the area would become suspicious if a marching army disappeared at one point to reappear at another. Even entering the area does not cancel the illusion or neces-sarily allow a save, assuming that hidden beings take care to stay out of the way of those affected by the illusion. </p>

     <p>You can see and hear some creature, which may be at any distance. If the subject succeeds on a Will save, the scrying attempt simply fails. The difficulty of the save depends on how well you know the subject and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to that creature. Furthermore, if the subject is on another plane, it gets a +5 bonus on its Will save. Knowledge Will Save Modifier None1 +10 Secondhand (you have heard +5 of the subject) Firsthand (you have met the subject) +0 Familiar (you know the subject well) –5 1 You must have some sort of connection to a creature you have no knowledge of. Connection Will Save Modifier Likeness or picture –2 Possession or garment –4 Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, etc. –10 If the save fails, you can see and hear the subject and the subject’s immediate surroundings (approximately 10 feet in all directions of the subject). If the subject moves, the sensor follows at a speed of up to 150 feet. As with all divination (scrying) spells, the sensor has your full visual acuity, in-cluding any magical effects. In addition, the following spells have a 5% chance per caster level of operating through the sensor: detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, detect magic, and message. If the save succeeds, you can’t attempt to scry on that subject again for at least 24 hours. </p>

     <p>Secret page alters the contents of a page so that they appear to be something entirely different. Thus, a map can be changed to become a treatise on burnishing ebony walking sticks. The text of a spell can be changed to show a ledger page or even another spell. Explosive runes or sepia snake sigil can be cast upon the secret page. A comprehend languages spell alone can-not reveal a secret page’s contents. You are able to reveal the original contents by speaking a special word. You can then peruse the actual page, and return it to its secret page form at will. You can also remove the spell by double repetition of the special word. A detect magic spell reveals dim magic on the page in question but does not reveal its true contents. True seeing reveals the presence of the hidden material but does not reveal the contents unless cast in combination with comprehend languages. A secret page spell can be dispelled, and the hidden writings can be destroyed by means of an erase spell.</p>

It can answer in like manner immediately. A creature with an Intel-ligence score as low as 1 can understand the sending, though the subject’s ability to react is limited as normal by its Intelli-gence score. Even if the sending is received, the subject is not obligated to act upon it in any manner.

     <p>When you cast sepia snake sigil, a small symbol appears in the text of one written work such as a book, scroll, or map. The text containing the symbol must be at least twenty-five words long. When anyone reads the text containing the symbol, the sepia snake springs into being and strikes the reader, provided there is line of effect between the symbol and the reader. Simply seeing the enspelled text is not sufficient to trigger the spell; the subject must deliberately read it. The target is entitled to a save to evade the snake’s strike. If it succeeds, the sepia snake dissi-pates in a flash of brown light accompa-nied by a puff of dun-colored smoke and a loud noise. If the target fails its save, it is engulfed in a shimmering amber field of force and immobilized until released, either at your command or when 1d4 days + one day per caster level have elapsed. While trapped in the amber field of force, the subject does not age, breathe, grow hungry, sleep, or regain spells. It is preserved in a state of suspended anima-tion, unaware of its surroundings. It can be damaged by outside forces (and perhaps even killed), since the field provides no protection against physical injury. How-ever, a dying subject does not lose hit points or become stable until the spell ends. The hidden sigil cannot be detected by normal observation, and detect magic reveals only that the entire text is magical. A dispel magic can remove the sigil. An erase spell destroys the entire page of text. Sepia snake sigil can be cast in combination with other spells that hide or garble text, such as secret page.</p>

     <p>When cast, this spell not only prevents divination spells from working to detect or locate the creature or object affected by sequester, it also renders the affected crea-ture or object invisible to any form of sight or seeing (as the invisibility spell). Thus, sequester can mask a secret door, a treasure vault, or anything similar. The spell does not prevent the subject from being discov-ered through tactile means or through the use of devices (such as a robe of eyes or a gem of seeing). Creatures affected by sequester become comatose and are effectively in a state of suspended animation until the spell wears off or is dispelled. Note: The Will save prevents an attended or magical object from being sequestered. There is no save to see the sequestered creature or object or to detect it with a divination spell.</p>

     <p>You use material from the Plane of Shadow to shape quasi-real illusions of one or more creatures, objects, or forces. Shadow conjuration can mimic any sorcerer or wiz-ard conjuration (summoning) or conjura-tion (creation) spell of 3rd level or lower. Shadow conjurations are actually one-fifth (20%) as strong as the real things, though creatures who believe the shadow conjura-tions to be real are affected by them at full strength. Any creature that interacts with the conjured object, force, or creature can make a Will save to recognize its true nature. Spells that deal damage, such as Melf’s acid arrow, have normal effects unless the affected creature succeeds on a Will save. Each disbelieving creature takes only one-fifth (20%) damage from the attack. If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is only 20% likely to occur. Regardless of the result of the save to disbelieve, an affected creature is also allowed any save that the spell being simulated allows, but the save DC is set according to shadow conjuration’s level (5th) rather than the spell’s normal level. In addition, any effect created by shadow conjuration allows spell resistance, even if the spell it is simulating does not. Shadow objects or substances, such as obscuring mist, have normal effects except against those who disbelieve them. Against disbelievers, they are 20% likely to work. A shadow creature has one-fifth the hit points of a normal creature of its kind (regardless of whether it’s recognized as shadowy). It deals normal damage and has all normal abilities and weaknesses. Against a creature that recognizes it as a shadow creature, however, the shadow creature’s damage is one-fifth (20%) normal, and all special abilities that do not deal lethal damage are only 20% likely to work. (Roll for each use and each affected character separately.) Furthermore, the shadow creature’s AC bonuses are one-fifth as large (so a +7 bonus resulting in AC 17 would change to a +1 total bonus for a new AC of 11). A creature that succeeds on its save sees the shadow conjurations as transparent images superimposed on vague, shadowy forms. Objects automatically succeed on their Will saves against this spell. </p>

     <p>You tap energy from the Plane of Shadow to cast a quasi-real, illusory version of a sorcerer or wizard evocation spell of 4th level or lower. (For a spell with more than one level, use the best one applicable to you.) Spells that deal damage, such as light-ning bolt, have normal effects unless an affected creature succeeds on a Will save. Each disbelieving creature takes only one-fifth damage from the attack. If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is one-fifth as strong (if applicable) or only 20% likely to occur. If recognized as a shadow evocation, a damaging spell deals only one-fifth (20%) damage. Regardless of the result of the save to disbelieve, an affected creature is also allowed any save (or spell resistance) that the spell being simulated allows, but the save DC is set according to shadow evocation’s level (5th) rather than the spell’s normal level. Nondamaging effects, such as gust of wind, have normal effects except against those who disbelieve them. Against dis-believers, they have no effect. Objects automatically succeed on their Will saves against this spell. </p>

     <p>To use the shadow walk spell, you must be in an area of shadowy illumination. You and any creature you touch are then trans-ported along a coiling path of shadowstuff to the edge of the Material Plane where it borders the Plane of Shadow. The effect is largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real. You can take more than one creature along with you (subject to your level limit), but all must be touching each other. In the region of shadow, you move at a rate of 50 miles per hour, moving normally on the borders of the Plane of Shadow but much more rapidly relative to the Material Plane. Thus, you can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Plane of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Material Plane. Because of the blurring of reality be-tween the Plane of Shadow and the Ma-terial Plane, you can’t make out details of the terrain or areas you pass over during transit, nor can you predict perfectly where your travel will end. It’s impossible to judge distances accurately, making the spell virtually useless for scouting or spying. Furthermore, when the spell effect ends, you are shunted 1d10×100 feet in a random horizontal direction from your desired endpoint. If this would place you within a solid object, you are shunted 1d10×1,000 feet in the same direction. If this would still place you within a solid object, you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space available, but the strain of this activity renders each creature fatigued (no save). Shadow walk can also be used to travel to other planes that border on the Plane of Shadow, but this usage requires the transit of the Plane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality. The transit of the Plane of Shadow requires 1d4 hours. Any creatures touched by you when shadow walk is cast also make the transition to the borders of the Plane of Shadow. They may opt to follow you, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into the Material Plane (50% chance for either of the latter results if they are lost or aban-doned by you). Creatures unwilling to accompany you into the Plane of Shadow receive a Will saving throw, negating the effect if successful. </p>

The creatures willingly aid you in combat or battle, perform a specific mission, or serve as bodyguards. The creatures remain with you for seven days unless you dismiss them. If the shamblers are created only for guard duty, however, the duration of the spell is seven months. In this case, the shamblers can only be ordered to guard a specific site or location. Shamblers summoned to guard duty cannot move outside the spell’s range, which is measured from the point where each first appeared. The shamblers have resistance to fire as normal shambling mounds do only if the terrain is rainy, marshy, or damp. </p>

     <p>This spell functions like polymorph, except that it enables you to assume the form of any single nonunique creature (of any type) from Fine to Colossal size. The assumed form cannot have more than your caster level in Hit Dice (to a maximum of 25 HD). Unlike polymorph, this spell allows incorporeal or gaseous forms to be assumed. You gain all extraordinary and super-natural abilities (both attacks and qualities) of the assumed form, but you lose your own supernatural abilities. You also gain the type of the new form (for example, dragon or magical beast) in place of your own. The new form does not disorient you. Parts of your body or pieces of equipment that are separated from you do not revert to their original forms. You can become just about anything you are familiar with. You can change form once each round as a free action. The change takes place either immediately before your regular action or immediately after it, but not during the action. For example, you are in combat and assume the form of a will-o’-wisp. When this form is no longer useful, you change into a stone golem and walk away. When pursued, you change into a flea, which hides on a horse until it can hop off. From there, you can become a dragon, an orc, or just about anything else you are familiar with. If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your Disguise check.</p>
     <p>Focus: A jade circlet worth no less than 1,500 gp, which you must place on your head when casting the spell. (The focus melds into your new form when you change shape.) </p>

Used as an area attack, shatter destroys nonmagical objects of crystal, glass, ce-ramic, or porcelain, such as vials, bottles, flasks, jugs, windows, mirrors, and so forth. All such objects within a 5-foot radius of the point of origin are smashed into do-zens of pieces by the spell. Objects weigh-ing more than 1 pound per your level are not affected, but all other objects of the appropriate composition are shattered. Alternatively, you can target shatter against a single solid object, regardless of composition, weighing up to 10 pounds per caster level. Targeted against a crystalline creature (of any weight), shatter deals 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 10d6), with a Fortitude save for half damage. </p>

Second, a warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against chaotic spells and spells cast by chaotic creatures.

The amount of damage not taken by the warded creature is taken by you. Forms of harm that do not involve hit points, such as charm effects, temporary ability damage, level draining, and death effects, are not affected. If the subject suffers a reduction of hit points from a lowered Constitution score, the reduction is not split with you because it is not hit point damage. When the spell ends, subsequent damage is no longer divided between the subject and you, but damage already split is not reassigned to the subject. If you and the subject of the spell move out of range of each other, the spell ends.</p>
     <p>Focus: A pair of platinum rings (worth at least 50 gp each) worn by both you and the warded creature. </p>

     <p>You are able to shrink one nonmagical item (if it is within the size limit) to 1/16 of its normal size in each dimension (to about 1/4,000 the original volume and mass). This change effectively reduces the object’s size by four categories (for in-stance, from Large to Diminutive). Op-tionally, you can also change its now-shrunken composition to a clothlike one. Objects changed by a shrink item spell can be returned to normal composition and size merely by tossing them onto any solid surface or by a word of command from the original caster. Even a burning fire and its fuel can be shrunk by this spell. Restoring the shrunken object to its normal size and composition ends the spell. Shrink item can be made permanent with a permanency spell, in which case the affected object can be shrunk and ex-panded an indefinite number of times, but only by the original caster. </p>

All sound is stopped: Conversation is impos-sible, spells with verbal components can-not be cast, and no noise whatsoever issues from, enters, or passes through the area. The spell can be cast on a point in space, but the effect is stationary unless cast on a mobile object. The spell can be centered on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. An unwilling creature can attempt a Will save to negate the spell and can use spell resistance, if any. Items in a creature’s possession or magic items that emit sound receive the benefits of saves and spell resistance, but unattended objects and points in space do not.

     <p>Simulacrum creates an illusory duplicate of any creature. The duplicate creature is partially real and formed from ice or snow. It appears to be the same as the original, but it has only one-half of the real creature’s levels or Hit Dice (and the appropriate hit points, feats, skill ranks, and special abilities for a creature of that level or HD). You can’t create a simu-lacrum of a creature whose Hit Dice or levels exceed twice your caster level. You must make a Disguise check when you cast the spell to determine how good the likeness is. A creature familiar with the original might detect the ruse with a suc-cessful Spot check (opposed by the caster’s Disguise check) or a DC 20 Sense Motive check. At all times the simulacrum remains under your absolute command. No special telepathic link exists, so command must be exercised in some other manner. A simulacrum has no ability to become more powerful. It cannot increase its level or abilities. If reduced to 0 hit points or otherwise destroyed, it reverts to snow and melts instantly into nothingness. A complex process requiring at least 24 hours, 100 gp per hit point, and a fully equipped magical laboratory can repair damage to a simulacrum.</p>
     <p>Material Component: The spell is cast over the rough snow or ice form, and some piece of the creature to be duplicated (hair, nail, or the like) must be placed inside the snow or ice. Additionally, the spell requires powdered ruby worth 100 gp per HD of the simulacrum to be created. </p>
     <p>XP Cost: 100 XP per HD of the simu-lacrum to be created (minimum 1,000 XP). </p>

     <p>A sleep spell causes a magical slumber to come upon 4 Hit Dice of creatures. Crea-tures with the fewest HD are affected first. Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell’s point of origin are affected first. Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. For example, Mialee casts sleep at one rat (1/4 HD), one kobold (1 HD), two gnolls (2 HD), and an ogre (4 HD). The rat, the kobold, and one gnoll are affected (1/4 + 1 + 2 = 3-1/4 HD). The remaining 3/4 HD is not enough to affect the last gnoll or the ogre. Mialee can’t choose to have sleep affect the ogre or the two gnolls. Sleeping creatures are helpless. Slap-ping or wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not. Awakening a creature is a standard action (an application of the aid another action). Sleep does not target unconscious crea-tures, constructs, or undead creatures.</p>

     <p>This spell enables you to make a snare that functions as a magic trap. The snare can be made from any supple vine, a thong, or a rope. When you cast snare upon it, the cordlike object blends with its sur-roundings (Search DC 23 for a character with the trapfinding ability to locate). One end of the snare is tied in a loop that contracts around one or more of the limbs of any creature stepping inside the circle. (The head of a worm or a snake could be thus ensnared, for example.) If a strong and supple tree is nearby, the snare can be fastened to it. The spell causes the tree to bend and then straighten when the loop is triggered, dealing 1d6 points of damage to the creature trapped and lifting it off the ground by the trapped limb or limbs. If no such tree is available, the cordlike object tightens around the creature, dealing no damage but causing it to be entangled. The snare is magical. To escape, a trapped creature must make a DC 23 Es-cape Artist check or a DC 23 Strength check that is a full-round action. The snare has AC 7 and 5 hit points. A successful escape from the snare breaks the loop and ends the spell. </p>

     <p>When this spell is cast, all natural, un-dressed earth or stone in the spell’s area is softened. Wet earth becomes thick mud, dry earth becomes loose sand or dirt, and stone becomes soft clay that is easily molded or chopped. You affect a 10-foot-square area to a depth of 1 to 4 feet, de-pending on the toughness or resilience of the ground at that spot (DM’s option). Magical, enchanted, dressed, or worked stone cannot be affected. Earth or stone creatures are not affected. A creature in mud must succeed on a Reflex save or be caught for 1d2 rounds and unable to move, attack, or cast spells. A creature that succeeds on its save can move through the mud at half speed, and it can’t run or charge. Loose dirt is not as troublesome as mud, but all creatures in the area can move at only half their normal speed and can’t run or charge over the surface. Stone softened into clay does not hinder movement, but it does allow characters to cut, shape, or excavate areas they may not have been able to affect before. For example, a party of adventurers trying to break out of a cavern might use this spell to soften a wall. While soften earth and stone does not affect dressed or worked stone, cavern ceilings or vertical surfaces such as cliff faces can be affected. Usually, this causes a moderate collapse or landslide as the loosened material peels away from the face of the wall or roof and falls. A moderate amount of structural dam-age can be dealt to a manufactured struc-ture (such as a wall or a tower) by softening the ground beneath it, causing it to settle. However, most well-built structures will only be damaged by this spell, not destroyed. </p>

     <p>This spell functions like <strong>fog cloud</strong>, but in addition to obscuring sight, the solid fog is so thick that any creature attempting to move through it progresses at a speed of 5 feet, regardless of its normal speed, and it takes a –2 penalty on all melee attack and melee damage rolls. The vapors prevent effective ranged weapon attacks (except for magic rays and the like). A creature or object that falls into solid fog is slowed, so that each 10 feet of vapor that it passes through reduces falling damage by 1d6. A creature can’t take a 5-foot step while in solid fog. However, unlike normal fog, only a se-vere wind (31+ mph) disperses these va-pors, and it does so in 1 round. Solid fog can be made permanent with a permanency spell. A permanent solid fog dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes.</p>

     <p>You draw the soul from a newly dead body and imprison it in a black sapphire gem. The subject must have been dead no more than 1 round per caster level. The soul, once trapped in the gem, cannot be returned through clone, raise dead, reincar-nation, resurrection, true resurrection, or even a miracle or a wish. Only by destroying the gem or dispelling the spell on the gem can one free the soul (which is then still dead).</p>
     <p>Focus: A black sapphire of at least 1,000 gp value for every Hit Die possessed by the creature whose soul is to be bound. If the gem is not valuable enough, it shatters when the binding is attempted. (While creatures have no concept of level or Hit Dice as such, the value of the gem needed to trap an individual can be researched. Remember that this value can change over time as creatures gain more Hit Dice.) </p>

     <p>You grant the semblance of life and intel-lect to a corpse, allowing it to answer sev-eral questions that you put to it. You may ask one question per two caster levels. Unasked questions are wasted if the dura-tion expires. The corpse’s knowledge is limited to what the creature knew during life, including the languages it spoke (if any). Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive. If the creature’s alignment was different from yours, the corpse gets a Will save to resist the spell as if it were alive. If the corpse has been subject to speak with dead within the past week, the new spell fails. You can cast this spell on a corpse that has been deceased for any amount of time, but the body must be mostly intact to be able to respond. A damaged corpse may be able to give partial answers or partially correct answers, but it must at least have a mouth in order to speak at all. This spell does not let you actually speak to the person (whose soul has departed). It instead draws on the imprinted knowledge stored in the corpse. The partially animated body retains the imprint of the soul that once inhabited it, and thus it can speak with all the knowledge that the creature had while alive. The corpse, however, cannot learn new information. Indeed, it can’t even remember being questioned. This spell does not affect a corpse that has been turned into an undead creature. </p>

     <p>A ghostly, glowing hand shaped from your life force materializes and moves as you desire, allowing you to deliver low-level, touch range spells at a distance. On casting the spell, you lose 1d4 hit points that return when the spell ends (even if it is dispelled), but not if the hand is destroyed. (The hit points can be healed as normal.) For as long as the spell lasts, any touch range spell of 4th level or lower that you cast can be delivered by the spectral hand. The spell gives you a +2 bonus on your melee touch attack roll, and attacking with the hand counts normally as an attack. The hand always strikes from your direction. The hand cannot flank targets like a creature can. After it delivers a spell, or if the hand goes beyond the spell range, goes out of your sight, the hand returns to you and hovers. The hand is incorporeal and thus cannot be harmed by normal weapons. It has improved evasion (half damage on a failed Reflex save and no damage on a successful save), your save bonuses, and an AC of at least 22. Your Intelligence modifier applies to the hand’s AC as if it were the hand’s Dexterity modifier. The hand has 1 to 4 hit points, the same number that you lost in creating it. </p>

     <p>The warded creature is immune to the ef-fects of one specified spell for every four levels you have. The spells must be of 4th level or lower. The warded creature effec-tively has unbeatable spell resistance re-garding the specified spell or spells. Natu-rally, that immunity doesn’t protect a creature from spells for which spell resist-ance doesn’t apply. Spell immunity protects against spells, spell-like effects of magic items, and innate spell-like abilities of creatures. It does not protect against supernatural or extraordinary abilities, such as breath weapons or gaze attacks. Only a particular spell can be protected against, not a certain domain or school of spells or a group of spells that are similar in effect. Thus, a creature given immunity to lightning bolt is still vulnerable to shocking grasp or chain lightning. A creature can have only one spell im-munity or greater spell immunity spell in effect on it at a time. </p>

     <p>Spells and spell-like effects targeted on you are turned back upon the original caster. The abjuration turns only spells that have you as a target. Effect and area spells are not affected. Spell turning also fails to stop touch range spells. Thus, a charm person spell cast at you could be turned back upon the caster and possibly enable you to use the charm effect on that individual, but a fireball could not be turned back, and neither could inflict critical wounds. From seven to ten (1d4+6) spell levels are affected by the turning. The DM se-cretly rolls the exact number. When a spell is turned, the DM subtracts its level from the amount of spell turning left. When you are targeted by a spell of higher level than the amount of spell turn-ing you have left, that spell is partially turned. The subtract the amount of spell turning left from the spell level of the incoming spell, then divide the result by the spell level of the incoming spell to see what fraction of the effect gets through. For damaging spells, you and the caster each take a fraction of the damage. For nondamaging spells, each of you has a proportional chance to be affected. For example, if you had three levels of spell turning left and were targeted by an inflict critical wounds spell (a 4th-level spell), you would turn three-fourths of the spell back at the caster. You would take one-forth of the damage, while the caster takes three-fourths of the damage. If you were targeted by a wizard’s fear spell (also a 4th-level spell) in the same situation, you would have a one in four (25%) chance to be affected by the spell, while the caster would have a three in four (75%) chance to be affected. If you and a spellcasting attacker are both warded by spell turning effects in operation, a resonating field is created. Roll randomly to determine the result. d% Effect 01–70 Spell drains away without effect. 71–80 Spell affects both of you equally at full effect. 81–97 Both turning effects are rendered nonfunctional for 1d4 minutes. 98–100 Both of you go through a rift into another plane. </p>

     <p>Any ground-covering vegetation in the spell’s area becomes very hard and sharply pointed without changing its appearance. In areas of bare earth, roots and rootlets act in the same way. Typically, spike growth can be cast in any outdoor setting except open water, ice, heavy snow, sandy desert, or bare stone. Any creature moving on foot into or through the spell’s area takes 1d4 points of piercing damage for each 5 feet of movement through the spiked area. Any creature that takes damage from this spell must also succeed on a Reflex save or suffer injuries to its feet and legs that slow its land speed by one-half. This speed penalty lasts for 24 hours or until the injured creature receives a cure spell (which also restores lost hit points). An-other character can remove the penalty by taking 10 minutes to dress the injuries and succeeding on a Heal check against the spell’s save DC. Spike growth can’t be disabled with the Disable Device skill. Note: Magic traps such as spike growth are hard to detect. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a spike growth. The DC is 25 + spell level, or DC 28 for spike growth (or DC 27 for spike growth cast by a ranger). </p>

     <p>A weapon made of pure force springs into existence and attacks opponents at a dis-tance, as you direct it, dealing 1d8 force damage per hit, +1 point per three caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). The weapon takes the shape of a weapon fa-vored by your deity or a weapon with some spiritual significance or symbolism to you (see below) and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form. It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn. It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so, for example, it can damage creatures that have damage reduction. As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the normal miss chance associated with incorporeality. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats (such as Weapon Focus) or combat actions (such as charge) do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers. Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon con-tinues to attack the previous round’s target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to. Even if the spiritual weapon is a ranged weapon, use the spell’s range, not the weapon’s normal range increment, and switching targets still is a move action. A spiritual weapon cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation affects it. A spiritual weapon’s AC against touch attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object). If an attacked creature has spell resist-ance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the spiritual weapon strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell. The weapon that you get is often a force replica of your deity’s own personal weapon, many of which have individual names. A cleric without a deity gets a weapon based on his alignment. A neutral cleric without a deity can create a spiritual weapon of any alignment, provided he is acting at least generally in accord with that alignment at the time. The weapons associated with each deity or alignment are as follows. Boccob: Quarterstaff, “Staff of Boccob” Corellon Larethian: Longsword, “Sahan-drian” Ehlonna: Longsword, “Jenevier” Erythnul: Morningstar, “Agony” Fharlanghn: Quarterstaff, “Traveler’s Friend” Garl Glittergold: Battleaxe, “Arumdina” Gruumsh: Spear, “Bloodspear” Heironeous: Longsword, “Justice-bringer” Hextor: Flail, “Executioner” Kord: Greatsword, “Kelmar” Moradin: Warhammer, “Soulhammer” Nerull: Scythe, “Lifecutter” Obad-Hai: Quarterstaff, “Stormstouch” Olidammarra: Rapier, “Swiftstrike” Pelor: Heavy Mace, “Sunscepter” St. Cuthbert: Heavy Mace, “The Mace of Cuthbert” Vecna: Dagger, “Afterthought” Wee Jas: Dagger, “Discretion” Yondalla: Short sword, “Hornblade” Chaos: Battleaxe, “The Blade of Change” Evil: Light flail, “The Scourge of Souls” Good: Warhammer, “The Hammer of Justice” Law: Sword, “The Sword of Truth” </p>

The subject can see, hear, and smell normally, but it does not need to eat or breathe. Feeling is limited to those sensa-tions that can affect the granite-hard sub-stance of the individual’s body. Chipping is equal to a mere scratch, but breaking off one of the statue’s arms constitutes serious damage.

     <p>When you need to keep track of comrades who may get separated, status allows you to mentally monitor their relative positions and general condition. You are aware of direction and distance to the creatures and any conditions affecting them: unharmed, wounded, disabled, staggered, uncon-scious, dying, nauseated, panicked, stunned, poisoned, diseased, confused, or the like. Once the spell has been cast upon the subjects, the distance between them and the caster does not affect the spell as long as they are on the same plane of existence. If a subject leaves the plane, or if it dies, the spell ceases to function for it. </p>

     <p>Stinking cloud creates a bank of fog like that created by fog cloud, except that the vapors are nauseating. Living creatures in the cloud become nauseated. This condition lasts as long as the creature is in the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds after it leaves. (Roll separately for each nauseated character.) Any creature that succeeds on its save but remains in the cloud must continue to save each round on your turn. Stinking cloud can be made permanent with a permanency spell. A permanent stinking cloud dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes.</p>

     <p>You can form an existing piece of stone into any shape that suits your purpose. For example, you can make a stone weapon, a special trapdoor, or a crude idol. Stone shape also permits you to reshape a stone door to make an exit where one didn’t exist or to seal a door shut. While it’s possible to make crude coffers, doors, and so forth with stone shape, fine detail isn’t possible. There is a 30% chance that any shape including moving parts simply doesn’t work. </p>
     <p>Arcane Material Component: Soft clay, which must be worked into roughly the desired shape of the stone object and then touched to the stone while the verbal component is uttered. </p>

Any petrified creature, regardless of size, can be restored. The spell also can convert a mass of stone into a fleshy substance. Such flesh is inert and lacking a vital life force unless a life force or magical energy is available. (For example, this spell would turn a stone golem into a flesh golem, but an ordinary statue would become a corpse.) You can affect an object that fits within a cylinder from 1 foot to 3 feet in diameter and up to 10 feet long or a cylinder of up to those dimensions in a larger mass of stone.</p>

     <p><sup><strong>Сопротивление магии:</strong> Yes </sup></p>
     <p>This spell creates an enormous black storm cloud. Lightning and crashing claps of thunder appear within the storm. Each creature beneath the cloud must succeed on a Fortitude save or be deafened for 1d4×10 minutes. If you do not maintain concentration on the spell after casting it, the spell ends. If you continue to concentrate, the spell generates additional effects in each fol-lowing round, as noted below. Each effect occurs during your turn. 2nd Round: Acid rains down in the area, dealing 1d6 points of acid damage (no save). 3rd Round: You call six bolts of lightning down from the cloud. You decide where the bolts strike. No two bolts may be directed at the same target. Each bolt deals 10d6 points of electricity damage. A creature struck can attempt a Reflex save for half damage. 4th Round: Hailstones rain down in the area, dealing 5d6 points of bludgeoning damage (no save). 5th through 10th Rounds: Violent rain and wind gusts reduce visibility. The rain obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). Speed is reduced by three-quarters. Ranged attacks within the area of the storm are impossible. Spells cast within the area are disrupted unless the caster succeeds on a Concentration check against a DC equal to the storm of vengeance’s save DC + the level of the spell the caster is trying to cast. </p>

     <p>You influence the actions of the target creature by suggesting a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two). The sug-gestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act auto-matically negates the effect of the spell. However, a suggestion that a pool of acid is actually pure water and that a quick dip would be refreshing is another matter. Urging a red dragon to stop attacking your party so that the dragon and party could jointly loot a rich treasure elsewhere is a likewise reasonable use of the spell’s power. The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire duration, such as in the case of the red dragon mentioned above. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. You can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special ac-tivity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a noble knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition is not met before the spell duration expires, the activity is not performed. A very reasonable suggestion causes the save to be made with a penalty (such as –1 or –2) at the discretion of the DM.</p>

     <p>This spell summons an extraplanar crea-ture (typically an outsider, elemental, or magical beast native to another plane). It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack partic-ular enemies, or to perform other actions. The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st-level list on the accompany-ing Summon Monster table. You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can change that choice each time you cast the spell. Information on these crea-tures can be found in the Monster Manual. A summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them. For instance, a celestial porpoise may only be summoned in an aquatic environment. When you use a summoning spell to summon an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type. For example, a summon monster I is a lawful and evil spell when cast to summon a fiendish dire rat. </p>

      <p>Symbol of Death </p>
     </title>
     <p><strong>Некромантия [Death] </strong></p>
     <p><sup><strong>Уровень:</strong> Clr 8, Sor/Wiz 8 </sup></p>
     <p><sup><strong>Компоненты:</strong> V, S, M </sup></p>
     <p><sup><strong>Время сотворения:</strong> 10 minutes </sup></p>

     <p><sup><strong>Спасбросок:</strong> Fortitude negates </sup></p>
     <p><sup><strong>Сопротивление магии:</strong> Yes </sup></p>
     <p>This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon a surface. When trig- gered, a symbol of death slays one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150. The symbol of death affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the symbol becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points’ worth of creatures, whichever comes first. Any creature that enters the area while the symbol of death is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the symbol only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the symbol is still active, it must save again. Until it is triggered, the symbol of death is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a sym-bol of death must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Cover-ing or hiding the rune renders the symbol of death ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the symbol of death works normally. As a default, a symbol of death is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can’t trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a symbol of death’s triggering condi-tions cannot be changed. In this case, “reading” the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a symbol of death to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch. You can’t use a symbol of death offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered symbol of death remains untriggered if an item bearing the symbol of death is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a symbol of death cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe. You can also set special triggering limi-tations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special con-ditions for triggering a symbol of death can be based on a creature’s name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don’t qualify. For example, a symbol of death can be set to activate when a lawful good creature approaches, but not when a paladin approaches. When scribing a symbol of death, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the effect. Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune’s effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again. You also can attune any number of crea-tures to the symbol of death, but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as ten creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as twenty-five creatures) takes 24 hours. At-tuning larger groups takes proportionately longer, as the DM sees fit. Any creature attuned to a symbol of death cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when triggered. You are auto-matically considered attuned to your own symbols of death, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them. Read magic allows you to identify a sym-bol of death with a DC 19 Spellcraft check. Of course, if the symbol of death is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol. A symbol of death can be removed by a successful dispel magic targeted solely on the rune. An erase spell has no effect on a symbol of death. Destruction of the surface where a symbol of death is inscribed destroys the symbol but also triggers it. Symbol of death can be made permanent with a permanency spell. A permanent symbol of death that is disabled or that has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal. Note: Magic traps such as symbol of death are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a symbol of death and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for symbol of death.</p>

     <p>By attuning yourself to a freestanding structure such as a building, bridge, or dam, you can create a damaging vibration within it. Once it begins, the vibration deals 2d10 points of damage per round to the target structure. (Hardness has no effect on the spell’s damage.) You can choose at the time of casting to limit the duration of the spell; otherwise it lasts for 1 round/ level. If the spell is cast upon a target that is not freestanding the surrounding stone dissipates the effect and no damage occurs. Sympathetic vibration cannot affect creatures (including con-structs). Since a structure is an unattended object, it gets no saving throw to resist the effect.</p>

     <p>You cause an object or location to emanate magical vibrations that attract either a spe-cific kind of intelligent creature or crea-tures of a particular alignment, as defined by you. The particular kind of creature to be affected must be named specifically—for example, red dragons, hill giants, wer-erats, lammasus, or vampires. A creature subtype (such as goblinoid) is not specific enough. Likewise, the specific alignment must be named—for example, chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful neutral, or neutral. Creatures of the specified kind or align-ment feel elated and pleased to be in the area or desire to touch or to possess the object. The compulsion to stay in the area or touch the object is overpowering. If the save is successful, the creature is released from the enchantment, but a subsequent save must be made 1d6×10 minutes later. If this save fails, the affected creature attempts to return to the area or object. Sympathy counters and dispels antipathy.</p>

     <p>This spell afflicts the subject with uncon-trollable laughter. It collapses into gales of manic laughter, falling prone. The subject can take no actions while laughing, but is not considered helpless. After the spell ends, it can act normally. A creature with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower is not affected. A creature whose type (such as humanoid or dragon) is different from the caster’s receives a +4 bonus on its saving throw, because humor doesn’t “translate” well.</p>

     <p>You move objects or creatures by concen-trating on them. Depending on the version selected, the spell can provide a gentle, sustained force, perform a variety of combat maneuvers, or exert a single short, violent thrust. Sustained Force: A sustained force moves an object weighing no more than 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level) up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect on an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with spell resistance. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or in both directions. An object cannot be moved beyond your range. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the range. If you cease concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops. An object can be telekinetically man-ipulated as if with one hand. For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the weight limita-tion. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require Intelligence checks against a DC set by the DM. Combat Maneuver: Alternatively, once per round, you can use telekinesis to per-form a bull rush, disarm, grapple (includ-ing pin), or trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they don’t provoke at-tacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place of your base attack bonus (for disarm and grapple), you use your In-telligence modifier (if a wizard) or Cha-risma modifier (if a sorcerer) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier, and a failed attempt doesn’t allow a reactive attempt by the target (such as for disarm or trip). No save is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies nor-mally. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration. Violent Thrust: Alternatively, the spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl one object or creature per caster level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level). You must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer). Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects such as a barrel) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects such as a boulder). Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves (and spell re-sistance) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell. If a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points). </p>

     <p>This spell instantly transports you to a designated destination, which may be as distant as 100 miles per caster level. Inter-planar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn’t exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent (see below) per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Me-dium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All crea-tures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As with all spells where the range is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is spell resistance appli-cable to you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and spell resistance. You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. You can’t simply teleport to the warlord’s tent if you don’t know where that tent is, what it looks like, or what’s in it. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible. To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the Teleport table. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table. Familiarity: “Very familiar” is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home. “Studied carefully” is a place you know well, either because you can currently see it, you’ve been there often, or you have used other means (such as scrying) to study the place for at least one hour. “Seen casually” is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. “Viewed once” is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic. “False destination” is a place that does not truly exist, such as if you scryed on a enemy’s sanctum but instead viewed a false vision, or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you (for instance, a home that has burned to the ground). When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from. On Target: You appear where you want to be. Off Target: You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10×1d10% of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be 15% off target. That’s 18 miles, in this case. The DM determines the direction off target randomly, such as by rolling 1d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, and so forth. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and would up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble. Similar Area: You wind up in an area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. A wizard heading for her home laboratory might wind up in another wizard’s laboratory or in an alchemy supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as in her laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If the DM determines no such area exists within the spell’s range, the spell simply fails instead. Mishap: You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten “scrambled.” You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time “Mishap” comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll. </p>

     <p>This spell functions like teleport, except that it teleports an object, not you. Crea-tures and magical forces (such as a delayed blast fireball bead) cannot be teleported. If desired, the target object can be sent to a distant location on the Ethereal Plane. In this case, the point from which the object was teleported remains faintly magical until the item is retrieved. A suc-cessful targeted dispel magic spell cast on that point brings the vanished item back from the Ethereal Plane. </p>

     <p>This spell functions like teleport, except that there is no range limit and there is no chance you arrive off target. In addition, you need not have seen the destination, but in that case you must have at least a reliable description of the place to which you are teleporting (such as a detailed description from someone else or a partic-ularly precise map). If you attempt to tele-port with insufficient information (or with misleading information), you disappear and simply reappear in your original location. Interplanar travel is not possible.</p>

     <p>You create a circle on the floor or other horizontal surface that teleports, as greater teleport, any creature who stands on it to a designated spot. Once you designate the destination for the circle, you can’t change it. The spell fails if you attempt to set the circle to teleport creatures into a solid object, to a place with which you are not familiar and have no clear description, or to another plane. The circle itself is subtle and nearly impossible to notice. If you intend to keep creatures from activating it accidentally, you need to mark the circle in some way, such as by placing it on a raised platform. Teleportation circle can be made perma-nent with a permanency spell. A permanent teleportation circle that is disabled be-comes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal. Note: Magic traps such as teleportation circle are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find the circle and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 34 in the case of teleportation circle.</p>

It floats along horizontally within spell range and will accompany you at a rate of no more than your normal speed each round. If not otherwise directed, it maintains a constant interval of 5 feet between itself and you. The disk winks out of existence when the spell duration expires. The disk also winks out if you move beyond range (by moving too fast or by such means as a teleport spell) or try to take the disk more than 3 feet away from the surface beneath it. When the disk winks out, whatever it was supporting falls to the surface beneath it.</p>

     <p>This spell seems to make time cease to flow for everyone but you. In fact, you speed up so greatly that all other creatures seem frozen, though they are actually still moving at their normal speeds. You are free to act for 1d4+1 rounds of apparent time. Normal and magical fire, cold, gas, and the like can still harm you. While the time stop is in effect, other creatures are invulnerable to your attacks and spells; you cannot target such creatures with any attack or spell. A spell that affects an area and has a duration longer than the remaining duration of the time stop (such as cloudkill) have their normal effects on other creatures once the time stop ends. Most spellcasters use the additional time to improve their defenses, summon allies, or flee from combat. You cannot move or harm items held, carried, or worn by a creature stuck in nor-mal time, but you can affect any item that is not in another creature’s possession.

     <p>This spell enables you to change all metal objects within its area to wood. Weapons, armor, and other metal objects carried by creatures are affected as well. A magic object made of metal effectively has spell resistance equal to 20 + its caster level against this spell. Artifacts cannot be transmuted. Weapons converted from metal to wood take a –2 penalty on attack and damage rolls. The armor bonus of any armor converted from metal to wood is reduced by 2. Weapons changed by this spell splinter and break on any natural attack roll of 1 or 2, and armor changed by this spell loses an additional point of armor bonus every time it is struck with a natural attack roll of 19 or 20. Only limited wish, miracle, wish, or simi-lar magic can restore a transmuted object to its metallic state. Otherwise, for example, a metal door changed to wood is forevermore a wooden door. </p>

     <p>This spell turns natural, uncut or un-worked rock of any sort into an equal volume of mud. If the spell is cast upon a boulder, for example, the boulder collapses into mud. Magical stone is not affected by the spell. The depth of the mud created cannot exceed 10 feet. A creature unable to levitate, fly, or otherwise free itself from the mud sinks until hip- or chest-deep, reducing its speed to 5 feet and causing a –2 penalty on attack rolls and AC. Brush thrown atop the mud can support crea-tures able to climb on top of it. Creatures large enough to walk on the bottom can wade through the area at a speed of 5 feet. If transmute rock to mud is cast upon the ceiling of a cavern or tunnel, the mud falls to the floor and spreads out in a pool at a depth of 5 feet. For example, a 10th-level caster could convert twenty 10-foot cubes into mud. Pooling on the floor, this mud would cover an area of forty 10-foot squares to a depth of 5 feet. The falling mud and the ensuing cave-in deal 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to anyone caught directly beneath the area, or half damage to those who succeed on Reflex saves. Castles and large stone buildings are generally immune to the effect of the spell, since transmute rock to mud can’t affect worked stone and doesn’t reach deep enough to undermine such buildings’ foundations. However, small buildings or structures often rest upon foundations shallow enough to be damaged or even partially toppled by this spell. The mud remains until a successful dispel magic or transmute mud to rock spell restores its substance—but not necessarily its form. Evaporation turns the mud to normal dirt over a period of days. The exact time depends on exposure to the sun, wind, and normal drainage. </p>

     <p>You can enter any normal plant (Medium or larger) and pass any distance to a plant of the same kind in a single round, re-gardless of the distance separating the two. The entry plant must be alive. The destination plant need not be familiar to you, but it also must be alive. If you are uncertain of the location of a particular kind of destination plant, you need merely designate direction and distance (“an oak tree one hundred miles due north of here”), and the transport via plants spell moves you as close as possible to the desired location. If a particular destination plant is desired (the oak tree outside your druid grove, for instance), but the plant is not living, the spell fails and you are ejected from the entry plant. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn’t exceed your maxi-mum load. You may also bring one addi-tional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maxi-mum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. Use the following equivalents to determine the maximum number of larger creatures you can bring along: A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those crea-tures must be in contact with you. You can’t use this spell to travel through plant creatures such as shambling mounds and treants. The destruction of an occupied plant slays you and any creatures you have brought along, and ejects the bodies and all carried objects from the tree. </p>

      <p>Trap the Soul </p>

     <p>Trap the soul forces a creature’s life force (and its material body) into a gem. The gem holds the trapped entity in-definitely or until the gem is broken and the life force is released, which allows the material body to reform. If the trapped creature is a powerful creature from another plane (which could mean a character trapped by an inhabitant of another plane when the character is not on the Material Plane), it can be required to perform a service immediately upon being freed. Otherwise, the creature can go free once the gem imprisoning it is broken. Depending on the version selected, the spell can be triggered in one of two ways. Spell Completion: First, the spell can be completed by speaking its final word as a standard action as if you were casting a regular spell at the subject. This allows spell resistance (if any) and a Will save to avoid the effect. If the creature’s name is spoken as well, any spell resistance is ignored and the save DC increases by 2. If the save or spell resistance is successful, the gem shatters. Trigger Object: The second method is far more insidious, for it tricks the subject into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word, automatically placing the creature’s soul in the trap. To use this method, both the creature’s name and the trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger object when the gem is enspelled. A sympathy spell can also be placed on the trigger object. As soon as the subject picks up or accepts the trigger object, its life force is automatically transferred to the gem without the benefit of spell resistance or a save.</p>
     <p>Material Component: Before the actual casting of trap the soul, you must procure a gem of at least 1,000 gp value for every Hit Die possessed by the creature to be trapped (for example, it requires a gem of 10,000 gp value to trap a 10 HD creature). If the gem is not valuable enough, it shatters when the entrapment is attempted. (While creatures have no concept of level or Hit Dice as such, the value of the gem needed to trap an individual can be researched. Remember that this value can change over time as creatures gain more Hit Dice.) Focus (Trigger Object Only): If the trigger object method is used, a special trigger object, prepared as described above, is needed. </p>

     <p>By means of this spell, you are able to as-sume the form of a Large living tree or shrub or a Large dead tree trunk with a small number of limbs. The closest in-spection cannot reveal that the tree in question is actually a magically concealed creature. To all normal tests you are, in fact, a tree or shrub, although a detect magic spell reveals a faint transmutation on the tree. While in tree form, you can observe all that transpires around you just as if you were in your normal form, and your hit points and save bonuses remain unaffected. You gain a +10 natural armor bonus to AC but have an effective Dexter-ity score of 0 and a speed of 0 feet. You are immune to critical hits while in tree form. All clothing and gear carried or worn changes with you. You can dismiss tree shape as a free action (instead of as a standard action). </p>

     <p>You gain the ability to enter trees and move from inside one tree to inside another tree. The first tree you enter and all others you enter must be of the same kind, must be living, and must have girth at least equal to yours. By moving into an oak tree (for example), you instantly know the location of all other oak trees within transport range (see below) and may choose whether you want to pass into one or simply step back out of the tree you moved into. You may choose to pass to any tree of the appropriate kind within the transport range as shown on the following table. Type of Tree Transport Range Oak, ash, yew 3,000 feet Elm, linden 2,000 feet Other deciduous 1,500 feet Any coniferous 1,000 feet All other trees 500 feet You may move into a tree up to one time per caster level (passing from one tree to another counts only as moving into one tree). The spell lasts until the duration expires or you exit a tree. This means that in a thick oak forest, a 10th-level druid could make ten transports over the course of 10 rounds, traveling as far as 30,000 feet (about 6 miles) in doing so. Each transport is a full-round action. You can, at your option, remain within a tree without transporting yourself, but you are forced out when the spell ends. If the tree in which you are concealed is chopped down or burned, you are slain if you do not exit before the process is complete. </p>

     <p>This spell functions like raise dead, except that you can resurrect a creature that has been dead for as long as 10 years per caster level. This spell can even bring back crea-tures whose bodies have been destroyed, provided that you unambiguously identify the deceased in some fashion (reciting the deceased’s time and place of birth or death is the most common method). Upon completion of the spell, the crea-ture is immediately restored to full hit points, vigor, and health, with no loss of level (or Constitution points) or prepared spells. You can revive someone killed by a death effect or someone who has been turned into an undead creature and then destroyed. This spell can also resurrect ele-mentals or outsiders, but it can’t resurrect constructs or undead creatures. Even true resurrection can’t restore to life a creature who has died of old age.</p>

     <p>You confer on the subject the ability to see all things as they actually are. The subject sees through normal and magical darkness, notices secret doors hidden by magic, sees the exact locations of creatures or objects under blur or displacement effects, sees invi-sible creatures or objects normally, sees through illusions, and sees the true form of polymorphed, changed, or transmuted things. Further, the subject can focus its vision to see into the Ethereal Plane (but not into extradimensional spaces). The range of true seeing conferred is 120 feet. True seeing, however, does not penetrate solid objects. It in no way confers X-ray vision or its equivalent. It does not negate concealment, including that caused by fog and the like. True seeing does not help the viewer see through mundane disguises, spot creatures who are simply hiding, or notice secret doors hidden by mundane means. In addition, the spell effects cannot be further enhanced with known magic, so one cannot use true seeing through a crystal ball or in conjunction with clairaudience/ clairvoyance.</p>

     <p>Unhallow makes a particular site, building, or structure an unholy site. This has three major effects. First, the site or structure is guarded by a magic circle against good effect. Second, all turning checks made to turn undead take a –4 penalty, and turning checks to rebuke undead gain a +4 profane bonus. Spell resistance does not apply to this effect. (This provision does not apply to the druid version of the spell.) Finally, you may choose to fix a single spell effect to the unhallowed site. The spell effect lasts for one year and functions throughout the entire site, regardless of its normal duration and area or effect. You may designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that share your faith or alignment, or creatures that adhere to another faith or alignment. For example, you may create a bless effect that aids all creatures of like alignment or faith in the area, or a bane effect that hinders creatures of the opposite alignment or an enemy faith. At the end of the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or replaced simply by casting unhallow again. Spell effects that may be tied to an unhallowed site include aid, bane, bless, cause fear, darkness, daylight, death ward, deeper darkness, detect magic, detect good, dimensional anchor, discern lies, dispel magic, endure elements, freedom of movement, invisibility purge, protection from energy, remove fear, resist energy, silence, tongues, and zone of truth. Saving throws and spell resistance might apply to these spells’ effects. (See the indi-vidual spell descriptions for details.) An area can receive only one unhallow spell (and its associated spell effect) at a time. Unhallow counters but does not dispel hallow.</p>

     <p>A malevolent darkness surrounds the sub-jects, protecting them from attacks, grant-ing them resistance to spells cast by good creatures, and weakening good creatures when they strike the subjects. This abjura-tion has four effects. First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike the effect of protection from good, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by good creatures. Second, a warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against good spells and spells cast by good creatures. Third, the abjuration blocks possession and mental influence, just as protection from good does. Finally, if a good creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the offending attacker takes 1d6 points of temporary Strength damage (Fortitude negates).</p>

     <p>You call up unholy power to smite your enemies. The power takes the form of a cold, cloying miasma of greasy darkness. Only good and neutral (not evil) creatures are harmed by the spell. The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to a good creature (or 1d6 per caster level, maximum 10d6, to a good outsider) and causes it to be sickened for 1d4 rounds. A successful Will save reduces damage to half and negates the sickened effect. The effects cannot be negated by remove disease or heal, but remove curse is effective. The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither evil nor good, and they are not sickened. Such a creature can reduce the damage in half again (down to one-quarter) with a successful Will save. </p>

     <p>An unseen servant is an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at your command. It can run and fetch things, open unstuck doors, and hold chairs, as well as clean and mend. The servant can perform only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity over and over again if told to do so, thus allowing you to command it to clean the floor and then turn your attention elsewhere as long as you remain within range. It can open only normal doors, drawers, lids, and the like. It has an effec-tive Strength score of 2 (so it can lift 20 pounds or drag 100 pounds). It can trigger traps and such, but it can exert only 20 pounds of force, which is not enough to activate certain pressure plates and other devices. It can’t perform any task that requires a skill check with a DC higher than 10 or that requires a check using a skill that can’t be used untrained. Its speed is 15 feet. The servant cannot attack in any way; it is never allowed an attack roll. It cannot be killed, but it dissipates if it takes 6 points of damage from area attacks. (It gets no saves against attacks.) If you attempt to send it beyond the spell’s range (measured from your current position), the servant ceases to exist.</p>

     <p>You instantly change the appearance of the subjects and then maintain that appear-ance for the spell’s duration. You can make the subjects appear to be anything you wish. A party might be made to resemble a mixed band of sprites led by a treant. The subjects look, feel, and smell just like the creatures the spell makes them resemble. Affected creatures resume their normal appearances if slain. You must succeed on a Disguise check to duplicate the appearance of a specific individual. This spell gives you a +10 bonus on the check. Unwilling targets can negate the spell’s effect on them by making Will saves or with spell resistance. Those who interact with the subjects can attempt Will disbe-lief saves to see through the glamer, but spell resistance doesn’t help. </p>

     <p>An immobile, blazing curtain of shimmer-ing violet fire springs into existence. One side of the wall, selected by you, sends forth waves of heat, dealing 2d4 points of fire damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of fire damage to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage when it appears and on your turn each round to all creatures in the area. In addition, the wall deals 2d6 points of fire damage +1 point of fire damage per caster level (maximum +20) to any creature pass-ing through it. The wall deals double damage to undead creatures. If you evoke the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. If any 5-foot length of wall takes 20 points of cold damage or more in 1 round, that length goes out. (Do not divide cold damage by 4, as normal for objects.) Wall of fire can be made permanent with a permanency spell. A permanent wall of fire that is extinguished by cold damage becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then reforms at normal strength. </p>

     <p>A wall of force spell creates an invisible wall of force. The wall cannot move, it is immune to damage of all kinds, and it is unaffected by most spells, including dispel magic. However, disintegrate immediately destroys it, as does a rod of cancellation, a sphere of annihilation, or a Mordenkainen’s disjunction spell. Breath weapons and spells cannot pass through the wall in either direction, although dimension door, teleport, and similar effects can bypass the barrier. It blocks ethereal creatures as well as material ones (though ethereal creatures can usually get around the wall by floating under or over it through material floors and ceilings). Gaze attacks can operate through a wall of force. The caster can form the wall into a flat, vertical plane whose area is up to one 10- foot square per level. The wall must be continuous and unbroken when formed. If its surface is broken by any object or creature, the spell fails. Wall of force can be made permanent with a permanency spell.</p>

     <p><sup><strong>Сопротивление магии:</strong> Yes </sup></p>
     <p>This spell creates an anchored plane of ice or a hemisphere of ice, depending on the version selected. A wall of ice cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Any creature adjacent to the wall when it is created may attempt a Reflex save to disrupt the wall as it is being formed. A successful save indicates that the spell automatically fails. Fire, including a fireball spell and red dragon breath, can melt a wall of ice, and it deals full damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage taken by objects). Suddenly melting a wall of ice creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes. Ice Plane: A sheet of strong, hard ice ap-pears. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level. It covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level (so a 10th-level wizard can create a wall of ice 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, or some other combination of length and height that does not exceed 1,000 square feet). The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored. A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides. The wall is primarily defensive in nature and is used to stop pursuers from following you and the like. Each 10-foot square of wall has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the wall auto-matically. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + caster level. Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains. Any creature stepping through it (including the one who broke through the wall) takes 1d6 points of cold damage +1 point per caster level (no save). Hemisphere: The wall takes the form of a hemisphere whose maximum radius is 3 feet + 1 foot per caster level. Thus, a 7th-level caster can create a hemisphere 10 feet in radius. The hemisphere is as hard to break through as the ice plane form, but it does not deal damage to those who go through a breach.</p>

     <p>You cause a flat, vertical iron wall to spring into being. This wall can be used to seal off a passage or close a breach, for the wall inserts itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. It must always be a flat plane, though you can shape its edges to fit the available space. A wall of iron is 1 inch thick per four caster levels. You can double the wall’s area by halving its thickness. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 25 + 2 per inch of thickness. If you desire, the wall can be created vertically resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface, so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures beneath it. The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction if left unpushed. Creatures can push the wall in one direction rather than letting it fall randomly. A creature must make a DC 40 Strength check to push the wall over. Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so by making successful Reflex saves. Any Large or smaller creature that fails takes 10d6 points of damage. The wall cannot crush Huge and larger creatures. Like any iron wall, this wall is subject to rust, perforation, and other natural phenomena.</p>

     <p>This spell creates a wall of rock that merges into adjoining rock surfaces. It is typically employed to close passages, portals, and breaches against opponents. A wall of stone is 1 inch thick per four caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. You can double the wall’s area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. Unlike a wall of iron, you can create a wall of stone in almost any shape you desire. The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the spell’s area by half. Thus, a 20th-level caster can create span with a surface area of ten 5-foot squares. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area. Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a disintegrate spell or by normal means such as breaking and chip-ping. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 15 hit points per inch of thickness and hard-ness 8. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 20 + 2 per inch of thickness. It is possible, but difficult, to trap mo-bile opponents within or under a wall of stone, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures. Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful Reflex saves. </p>

     <p>A wall of thorns spell creates a barrier of very tough, pliable, tangled brush bearing needle-sharp thorns as long as a human’s finger. Any creature forced into or attempting to move through a wall of thorns takes slashing damage per round of movement equal to 25 minus the creature’s AC. Dexterity and dodge bonuses to AC do not count for this calculation. (Creatures with an Armor Class of 25 or higher, without considering Dexterity and dodge bonuses, take no damage from contact with the wall.) You can make the wall as thin as 5 feet thick, which allows you to shape the wall as a number of 10-by-10-by-5-foot blocks equal to twice your caster level. This has no effect on the damage dealt by the thorns, but any creature attempting to break through takes that much less time to force its way through the barrier. Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall by making a Strength check as a full-round action. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds 20, a creature moves 5 feet (up to a maximum distance equal to its normal land speed). For example, a creature that rolled 25 on its Strength check could move 5 feet in a round. Of course, moving or attempting to move through the thorns incurs damage as described above. A creature trapped in the thorns can choose to remain motionless in order to avoid taking any more damage. Any creature within the area of the spell when it is cast takes damage as if it had moved into the wall and is caught inside. In order to escape, it must attempt to push its way free, or it can wait until the spell ends. Creatures with the ability to pass through overgrown areas unhindered can pass through a wall of thorns at normal speed without taking damage. A wall of thorns can be breached by slow work with edged weapons. Chopping away at the wall creates a safe passage 1 foot deep for every 10 minutes of work. Normal fire cannot harm the barrier, but magical fire burns it away in 10 minutes. Despite its appearance, a wall of thorns is not actually a living plant, and thus is unaffected by spells that affect plants. </p>

     <p>You cause wood to bend and warp, per-manently destroying its straightness, form, and strength. A warped door springs open (or becomes stuck, requiring a Strength check to open, at your option). A boat or ship springs a leak. Warped ranged weapons are useless. A warped melee weapon causes a –4 penalty on attack rolls. You may warp one Small or smaller ob-ject (such as a wagon wheel or a human’s crossbow) or its equivalent per caster level. A Medium object (such as an oar or a human’s spear) counts as two Small ob-jects, a Large object (such as a rowboat or a hill giant’s greatclub) as four, a Huge object (such as a wagon or a cloud giant’s morningstar) as eight, a Gargantuan object (such as a keelboat) as sixteen, and a Colossal object (such as a sailing ship) as thirty-two. Alternatively, you can unwarp wood (effectively warping it back to normal) with this spell, straightening wood that has been warped by this spell or by other means. Make whole, on the other hand, does no good in repairing a warped item. You can combine multiple consecutive warp wood spells to warp (or unwarp) an object that is too large for you to warp with a single spell. Until the object is completely warped, it suffers no ill effects. </p>

     <p>Web creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands. These strands trap those caught in them. The strands are similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher. These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points—floor and ceiling, opposite walls, or the like—or else the web collapses upon itself and disappears. Creatures caught within a web become entangled among the gluey fibers. Attacking a creature in a web won’t cause you to become entangled. Anyone in the effect’s area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the creature is entangled, but not prevented from moving, though moving is more difficult than normal for being entangled (see below). If the save fails, the creature is entangled and can’t move from its space, but can break loose by spending 1 round and making a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check. Once loose (either by making the initial Reflex save or a later Strength check or Escape Artist check), a creature remains entangled, but may move through the web very slowly. Each round devoted to mov-ing allows the creature to make a new Strength check or Escape Artist check. The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 10. If you have at least 5 feet of web be-tween you and an opponent, it provides cover. If you have at least 20 feet of web between you, it provides total cover (see Cover, page 150). The strands of a web spell are flammable. A magic flaming sword can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire—a torch, burning oil, a flaming sword, and so forth—can set the webs alight and burn away 5 square feet in 1 round. All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire damage from the flames. Web can be made permanent with a per-manency spell. A permanent web that is damaged (but not destroyed) regrows in 10 minutes.</p>

     <p>This spell creates a powerful cyclone of raging wind that moves through the air, along the ground, or over water at a speed of 60 feet per round. You can concentrate on controlling the cyclone’s every movement or specify a simple program., such as move straight ahead, zigzag, circle, or the like. Directing the cyclone’s movement or changing its programmed movement is a standard action for you. The cyclone always moves during your turn. If the cyclone exceeds the spell’s range, it moves in a random, uncontrolled fashion for 1d3 rounds—possibly endangering you or your allies—and then dissipates. (You can’t regain control of the cyclone, even if comes back within range.) Any Large or smaller creature that comes in contact with the spell effect must succeed on a Reflex save or take 3d6 points of damage. A Medium or smaller creature that fails its first save must succeed on a second one or be picked up bodily by the cyclone and held suspended in its powerful winds, taking 1d8 points of damage each round on your turn with no save allowed. You may direct the cyclone to eject any carried creatures whenever you wish, depositing the hapless souls wherever the cyclone happens to be when they are released. </p>

     <p>You send a message or sound on the wind to a designated spot. The whispering wind travels to a specific location within range that is familiar to you, provided that it can find a way to the location. (It can’t pass through walls, for instance.) A whispering wind is as gentle and unnoticed as a zephyr until it reaches the location. It then delivers its whisper-quiet message or other sound. Note that the message is delivered regardless of whether anyone is present to hear it. The wind then dissipates. You can prepare the spell to bear a message of no more than twenty-five words, cause the spell to deliver other sounds for 1 round, or merely have the whispering wind seem to be a faint stirring of the air. You can likewise cause the whispering wind to move as slowly as 1 mile per hour or as quickly as 1 mile per 10 minutes. When the spell reaches its objective, it swirls and remains in place until the message is delivered. As with magic mouth, whispering wind cannot speak verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects. </p>

     <p>You alter the substance of your body to a cloudlike vapor (as the gaseous form spell) and move through the air, possibly at great speed. You can take other creatures with you, each of which acts independently. Normally, a wind walker flies at a speed of 10 feet with perfect maneuverability. If desired by the subject, a magical wind wafts a wind walker along at up to 600 feet per round (60 mph) with poor maneu-verability. Wind walkers are not invisible but rather appear misty and translucent. If fully clothed in white, they are 80% likely to be mistaken for clouds, fog, vapors, or the like. A wind walker can regain its physical form as desired and later resume the cloud form. Each change to and from vaporous form takes 5 rounds, which counts toward the duration of the spell (as does any time spent in physical form). As noted above, you can dismiss the spell, and you can even dismiss it for individual wind walkers and not others. For the last minute of the spell’s dura-tion, a wind walker in cloud form auto-matically descends 60 feet per round (for a total of 600 feet), though it may descend faster if it wishes. This descent serves as a warning that the spell is about to end. </p>

     <p>An invisible vertical curtain of wind ap-pears. It is 2 feet thick and of considerable strength. It is a roaring blast sufficient to blow away any bird smaller than an eagle, or tear papers and similar materials from unsuspecting hands. (A Reflex save allows a creature to maintain its grasp on an object.) Tiny and Small flying creatures cannot pass through the barrier. Loose materials and cloth garments fly upward when caught in a wind wall. Arrows and bolts are deflected upward and miss, while any other normal ranged weapon passing through the wall has a 30% miss chance. (A giant-thrown boulder, a siege engine projectile, and other massive ranged weapons are not affected.) Gases, most gaseous breath weapons, and creatures in gaseous form cannot pass through the wall (although it is no barrier to incorporeal creatures). While the wall must be vertical, you can shape it in any continuous path along the ground that you like. It is possible to create cylindrical or square wind walls to enclose specific points. A 5th-level caster can create a wall up to 50 feet long and up to 25 feet high, sufficient to form a cylinder of wind 15 feet in diameter. </p>

     <p>Wish is the mightiest spell a wizard or sor-cerer can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality to better suit you. Even wish, however, has its limits. A wish can produce any one of the fol-lowing effects. Duplicate any wizard or sorcerer spell of 8th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you. Duplicate any other spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you. Duplicate any wizard or sorcerer spell of 7th level or lower even if it’s of a pro-hibited school. Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower even if it’s of a prohibited school. Undo the harmful effects of many other spells, such as geas/quest or insanity. Create a nonmagical item of up to 25,000 gp in value. Create a magic item, or add to the pow-ers of an existing magic item. Grant a creature a +1 inherent bonus to an ability score. Two to five wish spells cast in immediate succession can grant a creature a +2 to +5 inherent bonus to an ability score (two wishes for a +2 in-herent bonus, three for a +3 inherent bonus, and so on). Inherent bonuses are instantaneous, so they cannot be dispelled. Note: An inherent bonus may not exceed +5 for a single ability score, and inherent bonuses to a particular ability score do not stack, so only the best one applies. Remove injuries and afflictions. A single wish can aid one creature per caster level, and all subjects are cured of the same kind of affliction. For example, you could heal all the damage you and your companions have taken, or remove all poison effects from everyone in the party, but not do both with the same wish. A wish can never restore the experience point loss from casting a spell or the level or Constitution loss from being raised from the dead. Revive the dead. A wish can bring a dead creature back to life by duplicating a resurrection spell. A wish can revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but the task takes two wishes, one to recreate the body and another to infuse the body with life again. A wish cannot prevent a character who was brought back to life from losing an experience level. Transport travelers. A wish can lift one creature per caster level from anywhere on any plane and place those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies. Undo misfortune. A wish can undo a single recent event. The wish forces a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish could undo an opponent’s successful save, a foe’s successful critical hit (either the attack roll or the critical roll), a friend’s failed save, and so on. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies. You may try to use a wish to produce greater effects than these, but doing so is dangerous. Such a wish gives the DM the opportunity to fulfil your request without fulfilling it completely. (The wish may pervert your intent into a literal but un-desirable fulfillment or only a partial fulfillment.) For example, wishing for a staff of the magi might get you instantly transported to the presence of the staff’s current owner. Wishing to be immortal could get you imprisioned in a hidden ex-tradimensional space (as by an imprison- ment spell), where you could “live” indefi-nitely. Duplicated spells allow saves and spell resistance as normal (but save DCs are for 9th-level spells).</p>
     <p>Material Component: When a wish dup-licates a spell with a material component that costs more than 10,000 gp, you must provide that component. </p>
     <p>XP Cost: The minimum XP cost for casting wish is 5,000 XP. When a wish duplicates a spell that has an XP cost, you must pay 5,000 XP or that cost, whichever is more. When a wish creates or improves a magic item, you must pay twice the normal XP cost for crafting or improving the item, plus an additional 5,000 XP. </p>

While it is possible to make crude coffers, doors, and so forth, fine detail isn’t possible. There is a 30% chance that any shape that includes mov-ing parts simply doesn’t work. </p>

Confused: The creature is confused, as by the confusion spell, for 1d10 minutes. This is a mind-affecting enchantment effect. Killed: Living creatures die. Undead creatures are destroyed.

Creatures so banished cannot return for at least 24 hours. This effect takes place regardless of whether the creatures hear the word of chaos.

The actual point of arrival is a designated area no larger than 10 feet by 10 feet. You can be transported any distance within a plane but cannot travel between planes. You can transport, in addition to yourself, any objects you carry, as long as their weight doesn’t exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. Exceeding this limit causes the spell to fail. An unwilling creature can’t be tele-ported by word of recall. Likewise, a crea-ture’s Will save (or spell resistance) pre-vents items in its possession from being teleported. Unattended, nonmagical ob-jects receive no saving throw. </p>

    <p>As you complete the spell’s intricate gestures,you detect a slight buzz at the edge of your hearing. Your body feels warmer, and a feeling of security fills you. Spells and spell-like effects that target you are absorbed, their energy stored to power spells of your own. Absorption absorbs only ranged spells that have you as a target. Touch spells, effect spells, and area spells that affect you cannot be absorbed.Once the spell is cast, you can absorb 1d4+6 spell levels (rolled secretly by the DM). The level of each spell you absorb is subtracted from the total. If a spell is only partially absorbed (because its level exceeds the number of levels remaining to be absorbed), divide the number of spell levels left unabsorbedby the original spell level. For spellsthat deal damage, use the result todetermine what fraction of the damageyou take. For spells that create effects,use the result as a percentage chance tobe affected.For example, you have three spelllevels of absorption remaining andare struck by dominate person cast as a5th-level spell. Absorption absorbs threelevels of the spell, resulting in a 40%chance (2/5) that you will be affectednormally. If affected, any saving throwthe spell allows you still applies. Likewise, if you’re struck by disintegrate castas a 6th-level spell with four levels ofabsorption remaining, two levels of thespell remain, and you take only 33%(1/3) of the damage you would normallytake from the spell.You can use captured spell energyto cast any spell you know or haveprepared, but spells so cast don’t disappear from your list of prepared spellsor count against the number of spellsyou can normally cast per day (so youso must keep a running total of spelllevels absorbed and used). The levelsof spell energy you have stored mustbe equal to or greater than the level ofthe spell you want to cast, and you musthave at hand (and expend) any materialcomponents required for the spell</p>

    <p>You speak the ancient, slippery words asyou pour the iron and silver into the flask.Despite the fact that there is more powderthan room in the bottle, all of it dissolves,leaving a flask of water swirling withmotes of gold.This transmutation imbues a flask (1pint) of water with the energy of chaos,turning it into anarchic water. Anarchic water damages lawful outsidersthe way holy water damages undead andevil outsiders. A flask of anarchic watercan be thrown as a splash weapon.Treat this attack as a ranged touchattack with a range increment of 10feet. A flask breaks if thrown againstthe body of a corporeal creature, but touse it against an incorporeal creature,the bearer must open the flask andpour the anarchic water out onto thetarget. Thus, a character can douse anincorporeal creature with anarchicwater only if he is adjacent to it. Doingso is a ranged touch attack that does notprovoke attacks of opportunity.A direct hit by a flask of anarchicwater deals 2d4 points of damage toa lawful outsider. Each such creaturewithin 5 feet of the point where theflask hits takes 1 point of damage fromthe splash.Material Component: 5 pounds ofpowdered iron and silver (worth 25 gp)</p>

    <p>The arcane words that activate this spelllinger in the air for a moment. As theyfade from your hearing, you become moreaware of both your surroundings and thepossibility of intrusion.The subject of the spell is surroundedwith an invisible aura that anticipatesand delays the teleportation of anycreature into the spell’s area. Any teleportation spell or effect (including allspells with the teleportation descriptor)can be anticipated, making the spell’srecipient instantly aware of the exactlocation where the teleporting creaturewill arrive (subject to the restrictionsbelow), the creature’s size, and howmany other creatures (and their sizes)are arriving with the teleporting creature. The spell also delays the arrivalof the teleporting creature by 1 round(so that it arrives on its initiative countimmediately before its next turn),generally giving the recipient of thespell and anyone else made aware ofthe information 1 round to act or readyactions. The teleporting creature doesnot perceive this delay.Since a teleporting creature doesn’tnecessarily arrive at the precise location it intends, the spell also functionsagainst a creature that arrives in rangeeven though its intended destinationwas elsewhere. For a creature thatintends to teleport into range but inadvertently arrives outside the spell’s area,the spell gives the recipient awarenessthat a creature has attempted to teleportinto range and delays the creature asnormal, but doesn’t give any awarenessas to the actual location of its imminentarrival.The spell has no effect on creaturesattempting to teleport away from thespell’s area, although if their destination is within the area, the spell willaffect their reentry as normal.Focus: A tiny hourglass of platinumand crystal costing at least 500 gp, whichmust be carried or worn by the spell’srecipient while the spell is in effect.</p>

    <p>With the casting of this spell you are surrounded with a cool, blue mist that clingsto your body, dampening the heat of thenearby flames.You create an aura of blue mist thatprotects you against fire, absorbing thefirst 10 points of fire damage as a resistenergy (fire) spell (PH 272). In additionto the resist energy (fire) effect, the spellcan be used to snuff out fires.Any nonmagical flame that the auracontacts is immediately extinguishedif the flame’s maximum damage is 10or fewer points per round. This meansthat torches, small fires, and hurledalchemist’s fire are snuffed out andcause no damage if used against youor if you touch them.You can use a standard action totouch an existing magical fire (suchas a flaming sphere or a wall of fire) andattempt to dispel it as if using a dispelmagic spell against it (use the casterlevel of aura against flame for the casterlevel check). If you succeed, you takeno damage from the touch and themagical fire and aura both vanish. Ifyou fail, you take damage from themagical fire source normally (reducedby your aura against flame), and bothspells remain.With a readied action, you can usethe aura as a dispel magic effect to counterspell a magical fire attack againstyou. If successful, the spell is counterspelled and the aura disappears. If youfail the dispel check, or if the attack isnot a fire attack, the aura remains</p>

    <p>You shoot a black ray of necromantic energyfrom your outstretched hand, causing yourfoe to violently purge blood vessels throughits skin. The purged blood vessels spreadoutward, creating a many-layered mass ofbloody, adhesive tissue that traps nearbycreatures in a gory horror.You must succeed on a ranged touchattack with the ray to strike a target.If the attack is successful, the subjectloses half its hit points (roundeddown) and is stunned for 1 round. Ona successful Fortitude saving throw,the subject is not stunned. Oozes andplants are not affected by this spell.The avascular mass instantaneouslyerupts from the subject and mustbe anchored to at least two opposedpoints—such as floor and ceilingor opposite walls—or else the masscollapses and has no effect. Creaturescaught within a 20-foot-radius avascularmass become entangled. The originaltarget of the spell is automaticallyentangled. Because the avascular massis magically animate and graduallytightens on those it holds, an entangledcharacter who attempts to cast a spellmust make a DC 25 Concentrationcheck or lose the spell.Anyone within 20 feet of the primarytarget when the spell is cast must makea Reflex save. If this save succeeds, thecreature is not stuck in the avascularmass and is free to act, though movingmight be a problem (see below). If thesave fails, the creature is stuck. A stuckcreature can break loose by spending1 round and succeeding on a DC 20Strength check or a DC 25 EscapeArtist check. Once loose (either frommaking the initial Reflex save or alater Strength check or Escape Artistcheck), a creature can progress throughthe writhing blood vessels very slowly.Each round devoted to moving allowsthe creature to make a new Strengthcheck or Escape Artist check. The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 pointsby which the check result exceeds 10.If you have at least 5 feet of avascularmass between you and an opponent, itprovides cover. If you have at least 20feet of avascular mass between you, itprovides total cover.The avascular mass of entanglingtissue persists for 1 round per casterlevel.

    <p>The danger of the plane surprises you, andyou have barely time to bark out a few elderwords of power. In a moment you’re safe,and you gain a brief respite—time enoughto cast more permanent protective spells.You gain a temporary respite fromthe natural effects of a specific plane.These effects include extremes in temperature, lack of air, poisonous fumes,emanations of positive or negativeenergy, or other attributes of the planeitself (DMG 150).Avoid planar effects provides protection from the 3d10 points of firedamage that characters normally takewhen on a plane with the fire-dominant trait. Avoid planar effects allows acharacter to breathe water on a waterdominant plane and ignore the threatof suffocation on an earth-dominantplane. A character protected by avoidplanar effects can’t be blinded by theenergy of a major positive-dominantplane and automatically stops gainingtemporary hit points when they equalthe character’s full normal hit pointtotal. Negative-dominant planes don’tdeal damage or bestow negative levelsto characters protected by avoid planareffects.In addition, some effects specific to aplane are negated by avoid planar effects.In the DnD cosmology, avoid planareffects negates the deafening effect ofPandemonium and the cold damage onthe Cania layer of the Nine Hells. TheDM can add additional protections fora cosmology he creates. If the campaignhas an Elemental Plane of Cold, forexample, avoid planar effects protectsagainst the base cold damage dealt toeveryone on the plane.The effects of gravity traits, alignment traits, and magic traits aren’tnegated by avoid planar effects, nor isthe special entrapping trait of certainplanes (such as Elysium and Hades).The spell does not provide protection against creatures, native orotherwise, nor does it protect againstspells, special abilities, or extremeand nonnatural formations within theplane. This spell allows you to surviveon the Elemental Plane of Earth, forinstance, but it won’t protect you if youwalk into a pool of magma on that sameplane.Mass awaken creates powerfulallies for a drui</p>

    <p>You call upon the forces of law and a heavyrain begins to fall around you, its raindropsharsh and metallic. Above you, a jet ofcaustic acid lances down from the heavens.A driving rain falls around you. Itfalls in a fixed area once created. Thestorm reduces hearing and visibility,resulting in a –4 penalty on Listen,Spot, and Search checks. It also appliesa –4 penalty on ranged attacks madeinto, out of, or through the storm.Finally, it automatically extinguishesany unprotected flames and has a 50%chance to extinguish protected flames(such as those of lanterns).The rain damages chaotic creatures,dealing 2d6 points of damage per round(chaotic outsiders take double damage).In addition, each round, a gout of acidstrikes a randomly selected chaoticoutsider within the spell’s area, dealing 5d6 points of acid damage.

    <p>You speak the ancient, slippery words asyou pour the iron and silver into the flask.Despite the fact that there is more powderthan will fit in the container, all of it dissolves, leaving a flask of water dotted withmotes of gunmetal gray.This transmutation imbues a flask (1pint) of water with the order of law,turning it into axiomatic water. Axiomatic water damages chaotic outsidersthe way holy water damages undeadand evil outsiders. A flask of axiomatic water can be thrown as a splashweapon. Treat this attack as a rangedtouch attack with a range increment of10 feet. A flask breaks if thrown againstthe body of a corporeal creature, but touse it against an incorporeal creature,the bearer must open the flask andpout the axiomatic water out onto thetarget. Thus, a character can douse anincorporeal creature with axiomaticwater only if he is adjacent to it. Doingso is a ranged touch attack that does notprovoke attacks of opportunity.A direct hit by a flask of axiomaticwater deals 2d4 points of damage to achaotic outsider. Each such creaturewithin 5 feet of the point where theflask hits takes 1 point of damage fromthe splash.Material Component: 5 pounds ofpowdered iron and silver (worth 25 gp)</p>

Likea homunculus, it is an extension of its creator, sharing thesame alignment and link to nature. A bogun does not fightparticularly well, but it can perform any simple action, such asattacking, carrying a message, or opening a door or window.For the most part, a bogun simply carries out its creator’sinstructions. Because it is self-aware and somewhat willful,however, its behavior is not entirely predictable. On rare occasions (5% of the time), a bogun might refuse to perform aparticular task. In that case, the creator must make a DC 11Diplomacy check to convince the creature to cooperate. Success means the bogun performs the task as requested; failureindicates that it either does exactly the opposite or refusesto do anything at all for 24 hours (DM’s option as to which).A bogun cannot speak, but the process of creating onelinks it telepathically with its creator. It knows what its creator knows and can convey to him or her everything it seesand hears, up to a range of 500 yards. A bogun never travelsbeyond this range willingly, though it can be removed forcibly.In that case, it does everything in its power to regain contactwith its creator. An attack that destroys a bogun also dealsits creator 2d10 points of damage. If its creator is slain, abogun also dies, and its body collapses into a heap of rottingvegetation.A bogun looks like a vaguely humanoid mound of compost.The creator determines its precise features, but a typicalbogun stands about 18 inches tall and has a wingspan of about2 feet. Its skin is covered with nettles and branches.Combat: A bogun attacks by brushing against opponentswith harsh nettles that deliver an irritating poison.Construction: Unlike a homunculus, a bogun is createdfrom natural materials available in any forest. Thus, there isno gold piece cost for its creation. All materials used becomepermanent parts of the bogun.The creator must be at least 7th level and possess the CraftWondrous Item feat to make a bogun. Before casting anyspells, the creator must weave a physical form out of living(or once-living) vegetable matter to hold the magical energy.A bit of the creator’s own body, such as a few strands of hairor a drop of blood, must also be incorporated into this crudemannequin. The creator can assemble the body personally orhire someone else to do it. Creating this mannequin requiresa DC 12 Craft (basketweaving or weaving) check.Once the body is finished, the creator must animate itthrough an extended magical ritual that requires a week tocomplete. The creator must labor for at least 8 hours each dayin complete solitude in a forest grove; any interruption fromanother sentient creature undoes the magic. If the creator ispersonally weaving the creature’s body, that process and theritual can be performed together.When not actively working on the ritual, the creator mustrest and can perform no other activities except eating, sleeping, or talking. Missing even one day causes the process tofail. At that point, the ritual must be started anew, though thepreviously crafted body and the grove can be reused.On the final day of the ritual, the creator must personallycast control plants, wood shape, and beget bogun. These spellscan come from outside sources, such as scrolls, rather thanbeing prepared, if the creator prefers.pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrswraps itself around your hand, turning itinto smoke as well.With a successful touch attack, youdeal 2d12 points of damage.

    <p>You wave an ornate bottle about and smoketwists into it, filling it with a white cloud.You create a plume of smoke that youcapture in a special bottle you’re holding. If the bottle is thereafter openedbefore the spell duration expires, thesmoke emerges to form a vaguely horselike creature made of wisps of smoke.It makes no sound, and anything thattouches it simply passes through it.To mount this smoke horse, thewould-be rider must make a DC 10Ride check while holding the bottlein one hand. Anyone attempting tomount without the bottle simply passesthrough the horse’s form. Letting go ofthe bottle after mounting causes therider to fall through the horse’s smokyform; he or she cannot thereafterremount without the intact bottle inhand. If the bottle is broken, the spellends immediately and the rider (ifmounted) falls to the ground.The smoke horse has a speed of 20feet per caster level, to a maximum of240 feet. It can send smoke billowingout behind it at the rider’s behest, leaving behind a bank of smoke 5 feet wideand 20 feet high as it moves. A severewind, or magical wind of any kind,disperses the horse (and any smoke ithas produced) instantly. Otherwise,the bank of smoke lasts 10 minutes,starting on the turn it was laid down.Starting or stopping the smoke trail isa free action. The mount and the smoketrail it produces give concealment toanyone behind them.The mount is immune to all damageand other attacks because materialIllus. by W.

It cannot attack.The rider can return the smokehorse to the bottle, and thus pause thespell, at any time by simply uncorking it (a move action) and stopperingit again (another move action) in thenext round after the horse is inside. Ifthe bottle is reopened later, the spellreactivates with its remaining durationintact. Regardless of how much duration remains unused, the spell ceasesfunctioning 24 hours after it is cast.

    <p>You rattle the dice in your hand and mutterthe words of the spell, then check yourfacedown cards again. The two low cardshave somehow become trumps.At one point during the duration ofthis spell, you can attempt to alterthe outcome of a game of chance.This spell can affect only nonmagicalgames, such as those using cards ordice. It cannot affect a game involvingmagic, nor a magic item involved in agame of chance (such as a deck of manythings). Whenever a dice roll is made todetermine the outcome of the game, acharacter under the effect of this spellcan demand a reroll and take the betterof the two rolls.Anyone observing the game ofchance is allowed a Will saving throwto realize something fishy is going on,and might suspect that the outcome ofthe game has been magically altered.For example, Darkon is playing agame that he has a 1 in 4 chance ofwinning. The DM secretly rolls 1d4and tells the player that Darkon lost.Because Darkon is under the effect ofa cheat spell, the player can have theDM reroll. The spell alters probability,so there is no subterfuge that anothercharacter could notice (except for thecasting of the spell itself).Focus: A pair of dice made fromhuman bones</p>

A creature afflicted withthis disease takes 1d8 points of Dexteritydamage immediately, and each day thatthe disease persists, it must make a DC13 Fortitude save or take another 1d8points of Dexterity damage.The fog moves away from you at 10feet per round, rolling along the surfaceof the ground or water.

    <p>As you finish chanting the words, a pearlescent film covers your body before fading intoyour skin, a pale rainbow of colors offeringtheir protection against potential damageto come.This spell functions similarly to contingency (PH 213), but with a morelimited scope. While contingent energyresistance is in effect, if you are dealtdamage associated with one of the fivetypes of energy (acid, cold, electricity,fire, or sonic), the spell automaticallygrants you resistance 10 against thattype of energy for up to 10 minutes percaster level, or until the remainder ofthe spell’s duration, just as if you wereunder the effect of a resist energy spellof the appropriate type.Once the energy type protectedagainst by a particular casting of thisspell is determined, it can’t be changed.You can’t have more than one contingentenergy resistance in effect on yourself atthe same time—if you cast the spell asecond time while an earlier casting isstill in effect, the earlier spell automatically expires.The energy resistance granted bythis spell does not stack with similarbenefits against the same energy type(such as from the resist energy spell).However, it is possible to be simultaneously under the effect of resist energy(fire) and contingent energy resistance(electricity), or any other two such spellsthat protect against different types ofenergy.Material Component: An oyster shell</p>

    <p>With a quick invocation to your deity, youcall forth a nimbus of jet-black night. Thisterrible radiance, laced with the will ofyour deity, allows you to shoot black boltsof power.You unleash beams of darkness fromyour open palm. You must succeed ona ranged touch attack to strike yourtarget. You can hurl one bolt for everytwo caster levels you have (maximumseven bolts). You can hurl all the boltsat once, or you can hurl one bolt perround as a free action, starting in theround when you cast the spell. You donot have to hurl a bolt in every round,but if you don’t hurl the bolt you wereentitled to in a round, it is lost. If youhurl all the bolts at once, all your targetsmust be within 60 feet of each other.A darkbolt deals 2d8 points of damageto a living creature, and the creature isdazed for 1 round unless it makes a Willsave (a creature struck by multiple boltsduring the same round is dazed for amaximum of 1 round, no matter howmany times it fails its save). An undeadcreature takes no damage, but is dazedif it fails its save.Daggerspell stance turns its casterinto a deadly dervishIllus. by R. Horsle</p>

    <p>Your hand feels warm cupping the eldritchflames. You cannot see the fire in the shadows, but you know it is there, as will thosewho will soon feel the hungry flames.Dark flames appear in your hand. Youcan hurl them or use them to touchenemies. The flames appear in youropen hand and harm neither you noryour equipment. They emit no lightbut produce the same amount of heatas an actual fire.Beginning the following round, youcan strike opponents with a melee touchattack, dealing 1d6 points of fire damageper two caster levels (maximum 5d6).Alternatively, you can hurl the flames upto 120 feet as a thrown weapon. Whendoing so, you make a ranged touch attack(with no range penalty) and deal thesame damage as with the melee attack.No sooner do you hurl the flames thana new set appears in your hand.The darkfire is invisible to normalvision but can be seen with darkvisionas easily as a normal flame can be seenin darkness (this means that darkfirecan be used as a signal or beacon forcreatures with darkvision).The spell does not function underwater</p>

A DC 15 Healcheck or the application of any curespell or other healing magic stops thefestering. Only one wound festers at atime; additional wounds taken whilethe first is still festering are not subjectto this effect. Once festering has beenstopped, however, any new woundtaken while the subject is within thearea (before the spell expires) beginsthe process anew.For example, a subject who takes 6points of damage from an attack whilewithin the area of a decomposition spelltakes 3 points of damage from thefestering wound in the next round, andanother 3 points in the round after that.In the following round, that subjectreceives 4 points of healing from acure light wounds spell, so the festeringstops and the subject takes no festeringdamage that round.

    <p>You gesture toward your ally and call uponthe power of your beliefs. A soft, golden glowappears on your companion’s chest, aroundhis heart.The subject of this powerful spell isunable to die from hit point damage.While under the protection of thisspell, the normal limit of –9 hit pointsbefore a character dies is extendedwithout limit. A condition or spell thatdestroys enough of the subject’s bodyso as to not allow raise dead to work,such as a disintegrate effect, still kills thecreature, as does death brought aboutby ability score damage, level drain, ora death effect.The spell does not prevent thesubject from entering the dying stateby dropping to –1 hit points. It merelyprevents death as a result of hit pointloss.If the subject has fewer than –9hit points when the spell’s durationexpires, it dies instantly</p>

As the spell takes effect, adim yellow glow passes over the creature’sbody.The progress of any nonmagical disease that already afflicts the target ishalted for the duration of the spell.Delay disease allows the subject to skipthe required saving throw against thedisease for the day that the spell is ineffect. During this period, the subjectaccrues no further ability damage fromthe disease. A skipped saving throwcounts as neither a success nor a failurefor the purpose of recovery from thedisease. Furthermore, the incubationperiod of any disease to which thesubject is exposed during the spell’sduration does not begin until the spellexpires. Delay disease does not cure anydamage that a disease might alreadyhave dealt, and it has no effect on magical or supernatural diseases.DELUSIONS O</p>

    <p>By shouting flattering comments at yourintended subject, you release the energyof the spell. The target of your spell glowsmomentarily with a white nimbus ofcrackling energy that fades to a sickly graybefore disappearing completely.This powerful phantasm fools thesubject into believing itself morecompetent and safe than it really is.The spell makes any action the subject considers attempting seem easilyaccomplished, requiring only a tokeneffort. Deadly wounds seem like merescratches, stalwart foes appear weakand intimidated, and the subject’sown attacks seem stronger and moreeffective. As a result of its skewed perceptions, the subject takes a –2 penaltyon attack rolls, saves, ability checks,and skill checks, as well as to Wisdom. This penalty cannot reduce thesubject’s Wisdom below 1. Finally, thesubject becomes so completely enamored with its own (false) abilities thatit cannot fight defensively or take thetotal defense action</p>

    <p>By tossing down the sheet of crystal in yourhand and completing the mysterious wordsof power needed to release the energy of thespell, you create an immobile, shimmeringscreen of violet energy.Any spell effect operating on a creature or unattended object that passesthrough the screen is affected as by atargeted dispel magic (PH 223) at yourcaster level. Attended items that passthrough are not affected by the screen,which is the only way the screen differsfrom a normal targeted casting of dispelmagic—attended items are essentiallynot targeted by the screen. Make acaster level check (1d20 + 1 per casterlevel, maximum +10) to dispel spelleffects (DC 11 + caster level) or suppress an unattended object’s magicalproperties for 1d4 rounds (DC equalto the item’s caster level). Spell effectsnot operating on objects or creaturescannot pass through the screen. Adisintegrate or successful dispel magicremoves dispelling screen, while anantimagic field suppresses it.Material Component: A sheet of finelead crystal.DISPELLING SCREEN</p>

The subject’s hitpoints immediately drop to 0, and itfalls unconscious. In the next round,it loses another hit point (bringing itshit points to –1) and is dying. In thefollowing round, it dies.Coughing and other attempts by thesubject to physically expel the waterfrom its lungs are useless.

    <p>You scribe a spiral in the air with thediamond-tipped bit of charcoal, chantingthe words of the spell. Immediately the sidesof the cavern begin to contract, sealing thepassage behind you.You cause a 1-foot length of subterranean tunnel to constrict, “locking”it against others who might wish totraverse its length. This spell affectsonly naturally occurring tunnels orworked tunnels that are surrounded onall sides by unworked, natural, subterranean earth. You can affect any tunnelwhose diameter does not exceed 10 feet.A square-sided or rough tunnel can alsobe affected, as long as its diameter at thepoint where the spell is cast does notexceed 10 feet.The constriction takes 1 round tocomplete. Any Large or smaller object or creature that partially blocksthe constriction point is pushed, unharmed, to one side or the other. (Acreature can decide which way to move;an object moves randomly.) A Huge orlarger object or creature that blocks theconstriction point prevents the spellfrom working until moved.You can freely pass through tunnels that you have secured with thisspell. (The constriction opens andcloses on your command, taking1 round for either process). A tunnelsecured with earth lock can bebypassed by others in several ways. ADC 20 Escape Artist check allows thecreature making the check to squeezethrough the constrictionbut leaves it intact.A DC 25 Strengthcheck breaks theconstriction and endsthe spell. A successfuldispel magic or knockspell opens the constriction—the former byending the spell and thelatter by suppressing itfor 10 minutes. If a creature burrows through theearth lock, the spell ends.The constricted tunnelcan also be dug outnormally.Identifying a tunnelsecured with earth lock (asopposed to a tunnel thatjust ends) requires a DC20 Search check.Material Component: Adiamond chip worth at least50 gp, embedded in a pieceof charcoal</p>

Once the effect of the spell passes,the plants return to their normal shape.The DC to track anyone who traveledwithin the area of this spell increasesby 5 (the equivalent of hiding the trail).This spell has no effect on plant creatures (that is, they aren’t pushed or heldaside by its effect)</p>

    <p>Completing the powerful spell, you bringinto being floating spheres of silver, likebubbles of mercury.When you cast this spell, you bringforth one floating, silvery sphere percaster level, each about the size of yourhead. These spheres hover around youto provide protection from magicaleffects. As a standard action, you canshift the spell’s effect (and thus all thespheres) to any other creature withinrange. You can shift the effect onceper round.Each of these spheres can absorb andcompletely negate any spell or spell-likeability, regardless of level, that directlytargets the subject. The spheres do notautomatically absorb all spells; thesubject can choose whether or not to letthem absorb any given spell cast uponit. (This option allows the creature tobenefit from helpful spells.) Area spellsand spells that do not actually havea target cannot be absorbed. Once asphere has absorbed a spell or spell-likeability, it simply fades away.

    <p>You hold the eye in your palm, sprinkleit with blood and diamonds, and speakthe words. Slowly it rises from your hand,emitting a soft beam that illuminates thechosen area. Then it disappears, and youplace the spell within the magic trap.You create a lingering zone of transformative magic that absorbs magic energyfrom magic items or spellcasting anduses it to power another spell tied tothat location. For example, you couldhave an energy transformation field tiedto a summon monster V spell that wouldsummon a monster when the field hadabsorbed enough magic.The field absorbs the magic of spellscast, spell-like or supernatural abilitiesthat are activated, and magic items usedwithin its dimensions. Each source ofmagic provides spell levels of energy tothe field equal to the spell level of theeffect used. Supernatural abilities thatemulate spells provide energy equalto the spell level of the effect. Supernatural abilities that do not emulatespells provide energy equal to the HDof the creature using the ability. Forexample, a cast fireball spell or a chargefrom a wand of fireball would add threespell levels to the field’s store, a potionof cure light wounds would add one,and a wish from a ring of three wisheswould add nine. Items that don’t havea clearly defined spell level (such asthe effects of most rods) use the prerequisite caster level needed to createthat item (so an immovable rod wouldprovide two spell levels every timeit was activated because of its levitateprerequisite). Effects that are absorbedgive no indication of where the magicwent; they simply vanish.The field absorbs only magic that isactually used within its area. Ongoingmagical effects that enter the area,including spells cast from outsidethe area into the field or continuallyfunctioning items such as a +1 mace,are often visibly reduced, but do nothave their actual effects hindered. Forexample, a continual flame would dimslightly, but its overall magic would notbe affected.An energy transformation field hasa single spell linked to it. When thefield has absorbed spell levels equalto the spell level of its linked spell, itautomatically casts that spell at a pointwithin the field designated by you atthe time of the casting of the field. Thisexpends those absorbed spell levels(although unused levels remain untilthey are used or expire). The cast spellfunctions as if cast by you in termsof duration and all level-basedspell effects. Absorbed spelllevels fade at a rate of one perday if not used. Thefield automaticallytriggers its linkedspell if it hasenoughstored spelllevelsand the duration of its previous casting has expired. If a linked spellrequires concentration to maintain,the field expends one spell level forevery hour of concentration (the field’sconcentration is interrupted only byits complete destruction). Spells thatrequire a target will target the livingcreature nearest to the field.Typical spells linked to an energytransformation field are blindness/deafness, fireball, suggestion, summon monster,or wall of force. Spells that have a costlymaterial component or an XP costcannot be linked to a field, but thosewith a costly focus can if the focusobject is present within the field (typically sealed into a wall or in a secretcompartment).Only Mordenkainen’s disjunction,limited wish, wish, or similar spells candestroy the energy transformation field.Spells of lower level, such as dispel magicand greater dispel magic, are absorbed byit, and an antimagic field prevents it fromabsorbing magical energy within thefield but does not otherwise hamperthis spell. If two or more field spellsshare an overlapping area, each fieldhas an equal chance of absorbing a spelleffect in that area.Material Component: Three drops ofyour blood, an eye from any humanoid, and 5,000 gp worth of powdereddiamond.XP Cost: 250 XP</p>

    <p>Your breath weapon explodes from yourmouth, brilliant but mixed with sharpspikes of living darkness.For this spell to function, you musthave a breath weapon, either as a supernatural ability or as the result of castinga spell such as dragon breath (page 73).When you successfully cast this spell,you can modify your breath weapon sothat it is laced with negative energy. Inaddition to the normal energy damageyour breath weapon deals, creaturesthat fail their saving throws against thebreath weapon gain 2d4 negative levels.If the subject gains at least as manynegative levels as it has Hit Dice, it dies.Each negative level gives a creaturethe following penalties: –1 penalty onattack rolls, saving throws, skill checks,ability checks, and effective level (fordetermining the power, duration, DC,and other details of spells or specialabilities). Additionally, a spellcasterloses one spell or spell slot from herhighest available level.Assuming the subjects survive,they regain lost levels after a numberof hours equal to your caster level.Ordinarily, negative levels have achance of permanently draining thesubject’s level, but the negative levelsfrom enervating breath don’t last longenough to do so.If an undead creature is caughtwithin the breath weapon, it gains2d4×5 temporary hit points beforetaking damage from the breath weapon.These temporary hit points last for upto 1 hour</p>

The cocoon hashardness 10 and 10 hitpoints per caster level.The enveloping cocoonprevents the creaturetrapped inside from moving or casting spells withsomatic components. Thecocoon is too confiningto permit effective attackswith anything larger thana natural or light weapon(and the creature inside canattack only the cocoon inany event).You can attach a second spell to the cocoonby casting it at the cocoon. When the envelopingcocoon spell ends or is dismissed, theattached spell automatically affects thecreature inside, with no save allowed(although spell resistance, if any, stillapplies). If the cocoon is destroyedbefore it is dismissed or the spell duration ends, the attached spell is wasted.Any of the following spells fromthis book can be attached to an enveloping cocoon: infestation of maggots,languor, miasma, and phantasmal disorientation. In addition, a cocoon can beused in conjunction with these spellsfrom the Player’s Handbook: balefulpolymorph, blight, contagion, dominateanimal, flame strike, and poison (thesubject fails the initial save but canattempt the second save).Material Component: A live caterpillar.Entangling staff makesa simple piece of woodinto a surprisinglyversatile weaponIllus. by M.

    <p>Your voice trails off into whispers as younear the end of the spell’s complex ritual.The whispers begin to build upon oneanother, echoing in the air around you,swirling and twisting until they become asteady cacophony. The wind gathers speed,creating a spherical vortex around you.With this spell, you create a swirlingminiature storm that provides a measure of protection, but leaves you andthose near you unaffected.The storm that surroundsyou has hurricane-forcewinds spinning in a circlewith you at the center.Normal ranged attacksthrough the hurricane’swindy area are impossible, and even heavierprojectiles such as siegeweapons and giant boulders take a –8 penalty onthe attack roll.Creatures who move inside the spell’s area suffereffects depending on theirsize and whether they’reairborne.

    <p>Your invocation creates a miniature floatingeye of faintly glowing blue energy. Spyingyour enemy from the safety of your magicalsensor, you unleash your spell.This spell functions like arcane eye (PH200), except as noted here. You can castany spell of 3rd level or lower that hasa range other than personal throughthe eye. Any spell so cast functions asthough it had been cast from the eye’slocation rather than yours. Casting anyspell of higher than 3rd level throughthe eye not only produces no effect(though the spell is still expended),but it destroys the eye of power and endsthe spell.Unlike an arcane eye, an eye of poweris visible and corporeal, so it can bedestroyed. The eye is a Fine object withAC 18 and 77 hit points. It uses yoursave bonuses for saving throws.Material Component: A bit of bat fur</p>

Thefires you enter and move between mustbe at least as big around as you are. Fireelementals and other fire creatures arenot considered “fires” for the purpose ofthis spell, nor are sources of great heat,such as pools of lava.Once in a fire, you instantly knowthe locations of all suitable fires withinlong range (400 ft. + 40 ft./level) andcan transport yourself to one of them.Each transport counts as a full-roundaction. With each casting of the spell,you can transport yourself once percaster level. If a fire’s location doesn’toffer enough space for you (for example,a fire contained inside a furnace toosmall to hold you or a fire alreadyoccupied by a big cauldron), it is not aviable destination and you don’t senseits location. If a fire rests on a surfacethat can’t support you, it is still a viabledestination and you suffer the appropriate consequences if you transportyourself to it. For example, if youtransport yourself into a fire burningin a pit full of oil, you fall into the oilwhen you arrive there.Fire stride provides no protectionagainst fire, so it is advisable to obtainsuch protection before using the spell</p>

    <p>In a flash of light and a roar of fire, yourarms become wings of flame.This spell transforms your arms intowings of brilliant fire. The flame doesnot damage you or any items you carry.Because your arms are transformed,you cannot hold items in your handsor cast spells that require somaticcomponents, but rings, bracers, andother items worn on your arms whenyou cast the spell still function normally. The wings allow you to fly at aspeed of 60 feet (or 40 feet if you wearmedium or heavy armor), with goodmaneuverability. You can charge butnot run while flying, and you cannotcarry more than a light load aloft. Usinga fire wings spell requires only as muchconcentration as walking, so you cantake other actions normally.If the spell duration expires whileyou are aloft, you descend at a rate of 60feet per round for 1d6 rounds, then fallthe rest of the distance if you haven’talready landed. Because dispelling aspell effectively ends it, the subject alsodescends in this way if the fire wingsspell is dispelled, but not if it is negatedby an antimagic field.If you are not flying, you can make upto two attacks each round with the firewings as if they were natural weapons.A successful attack deals 2d6 points offire damage.The wings can be extinguished (andthe spell canceled) by a quench spell,immersion in water, or a wind of hurricane or greater force.Material Component: The feather of abird, which you must burn when youcast the spell.Focus: A golden amulet shaped like aphoenix (worth 150 gp)</p>

    <p>With a cruel utterance, you complete thespell and unleash its terrible energy. Asickeningly wet ripping sound accompaniesthe sight of strips of flesh being torn away,as if some invisible hand was attemptingto peel your target like an onion.When you cast this spell, you literallystrip the flesh from a corporeal creature’s body, inflicting incredible painand psychological trauma. Each round,the subject takes 2d6 points of damage,1d6 points of Charisma damage, and1d6 points of Constitution damage. Asuccessful Fortitude save negates theability damage and reduces the hitpoint damage by half for that round,but does not end the spell.Flensing has no effect on creatures ingaseous form.Material Component: An onion</p>

A creature orobject that falls into the fog from aboveis slowed, so that each 10 feet of mistit passes through effectively reducesoverall falling damage by 1d6.Freezing fog also coats all solid surfaces in its area with a slick, icy rime,and on your turn each round, eachcreature in the area of the fog mustmake a successful Reflex save or fallprone. A creature that manages to standmust make a DC 10 Balance check inorder to move, falling prone if it failsits save by 5 or more.

    <p>Convulsing, the touched subject’s limbsbegin to ooze together with a sickening noiselike a pot of melted wax splattering on thefloor. With a lurch they form into one pairof massive limbs.You cause a creature’s multiple arms ortentacles to fuse together into a singlepair of stronger limbs. Only limbs thatthe creature can use as arms or graspinglimbs are affected by the spell (so basilisks and monstrous centipedes, neitherof which use their limbs to attack ormanipulate objects, are unaffected).For every set of limbs fused into theprimary set of limbs, the creature gains+4 to Strength when using those fusedlimbs (affecting activities that woulduse those limbs, but not activitiesrelying on its bite, legs, and so on). Forexample, a girallon under the effect ofthis spell would have one pair of armsand Strength 26 for the purpose ofusing those arms. A behir, which hasthree pairs of limbs that it can use asarms, would end up with one pair ofarm-limbs with a +8 bonus to Strengthfor those arms (its six legs would beunaffected).The loss of limbs might reduce thenumber of attacks available to thesubject.If the subject has only two arms ortentacles, they are fused into a singlelimb, and the creature gains a +4 bonusto Strength on attack rolls made withthat limb</p>

You can be harmed onlyby other incorporeal creatures, magicweapons or creatures that strike asmagic weapons, and spells, spell-likeabilities, or supernatural abilities.You are immune to all nonmagicalattack forms. Even when hit by spells,including touch spells, or magic weapons, you have a 50% chance to ignoreany damage from a corporeal source(except for positive energy, negative energy, force effects, or attacksmade with ghost touch weapons).Nondamaging spell effects affect younormally unless they require corporealtargets to function (such as implosion)or they create a corporeal effect thatincorporeal creatures would normallybe unaffected by (such as a web or wallof stone spell).Your attacks while in ghostformpass through (ignore) natural armor,armor, and shields, although deflection bonuses and force effects (suchas mage armor) work normally againstyou. Nonmagical attacks you makewith a melee weapon have no effecton corporeal targets, and any meleeattack you make with a magic weaponagainst a corporeal target has a 50%miss chance, except for attacks youmake with a ghost touch weapon,which are made normally (no misschance). Spells you cast while in ghostform affect corporeal targets normally,including spells that require you tomake an attack roll (such as rays ormelee touch spells).Any equipment you are wearing orcarrying is also incorporeal as longas it remains in your possession. Anobject that you relinquish loses itsincorporeal quality (and you lose theability to manipulate the object). Ifyou use a thrown weapon or a rangedweapon, the projectile becomes corporeal as soon as it is fired and can affecta corporeal target normally (no misschance). Magic items you possess worknormally with respect to their effectson you or on another target.As an incorporeal creature, youhave no natural armor bonus but havea deflection bonus equal to your Charisma bonus (always at least +1, even ifyour Charisma score does not normallyprovide a bonus).You can enter or pass through solidobjects while in ghostform, but you mustremain adjacent to the object’s exterior,and so you cannot pass entirely throughan object whose space is larger thanyour own. You can sense the presenceof creatures or objects within a squareadjacent to your current location, butenemies have total concealment fromyou while you are inside an object. Inorder to see farther from the object youare in and attack normally, you mustemerge. While inside an object, youhave total cover, but when you attacka creature outside the object you havecover only, so a creature outside witha readied action could strike at you asyou attack. You cannot pass through aforce effect.You can pass through and operatein water as easily as you do in air. Youcannot fall or take falling damage. Youcannot make trip or grapple attacks,nor can you be tripped or grappled.In fact, you cannot take any physicalaction that would move or manipulatean opponent or its equipment, nor areyou subject to such actions. You haveno weight while in ghostform and donot set off traps that are triggered byweight.You move silently and cannot beheard with Listen checks if you don’twish to be while in ghostform. You haveno Strength score while incorporeal,so your Dexterity modifier applies toboth your melee attacks and rangedattacks.

    <p>The faint, green glow of the glyph flares tolife. A sickly green light fills the room, illuminating the paralyzed forms of its victims,and bringing with it the stench of death.You inscribe a glyph, approximately1 foot across, that paralyzes anyliving creature of Large or smallersize that comes within 5 feet of theglyph. You can scribe the glyph tobe visible as faintly glowing lines,or invisible. You can inscribe a ghoulglyph on a portable object, but if theobject is moved more than 5 feet, theglyph fades.Conditions for triggering a ghoulglyph are stringent. It takes effect onany creature except yourself that moveswithin 5 feet. It affects invisible creatures normally but is not triggered bythose that travel past it ethereally. Onlya single ghoul glyph can be inscribed ina 5-foot square.Ghoul glyphs cannot be affected orbypassed by such means as physical ormagical probing, though they can bedispelled. Mislead and nondetection canfool a ghoul glyph.Read magic allows identification ofa ghoul glyph with a successful DC 13Spellcraft check, if the glyph is noticedbefore it is activated. A rogue can usethe Search skill to find a ghoul glyph andDisable Device to thwart it. The DC ineach case is 27.When a glyph is activated, the target isparalyzed for 1d6+2 rounds. Additionally, if the target fails a Fortitude save,the paralyzed subject exudes a carrionstench that causes distress in all creatures within a 10-foot radius. Those inthe radius, including the target, mustmake a Fortitude save or take a –2penalty on attack rolls, weapon damagerolls, saving throws, skill checks, andability checks until the paralysis effectwears off.Material Component: You trace theglyph with earth from a ghoul’s lair</p>

    <p>You rub your hands along the length ofthe object, intoning the spell. A warm redglow emits from your hands, strengtheningthe object.This spell increases the hardness ofmaterials. Paper becomes harder totear, glass becomes harder to break,wood becomes more resilient, and soon. For every two caster levels, add1 point of hardness to the materialtargeted by the spell. This hardnessincrease improves only the material’sresistance to damage. Nothing else ismodified by the improvement. Forexample, a longsword (treat steel asiron, base hardness 10) affected bya hardening spell cast by a 12th-levelcaster would have hardness 16 forthe purpose of ignoring damagecaused by someone making a sunderattack.

Spontaneous spellcasters, such as sorcerers,can imbue a familiar with any spellsthey know how to cast, subject to therestrictions below. Arcanists who prepare spells, such as wizards, can imbuea familiar with any spell they havecurrently prepared. In either case, youcan imbue one spell per three casterlevels, with a maximum spell level ofone-third your caster level, roundeddown (maximum 5th level). Multiplecastings of imbue familiar with spellability have no effect on these limits.The transferred spell’s variablecharacteristics (range, duration, area,and so on) function according to yourlevel. Once you cast imbue familiarwith spell ability on your familiar,both the spell slot from which youcast the spell and the spell slots of thetransferred spells remain unavailablefor the preparation or casting of newspells until the familiar uses thetransferred spells or imbue familiarwith spell ability expires.The spell can be dispelled; if thishappens, the spells transferred arelost as if the familiar had cast them.In an antimagic field, the familiar losesthe ability to cast the imbued spells,but regains it again if it leaves the field(as long as the spell’s duration hasn’texpired).If any transferred spell requires afocus or material component, you musthave it on your person when the spellsare cast (components are consumedas normal without requiring you tobring them to hand).

    <p>Your spell creates a bond between yourselfand the creature you touch, a bond unbroken even by the distance between planes.This spell allows you to send a limitedmessage of twenty-five words or lessto the targeted creature, who can beon another plane when the messageis received.Casting the spell takes a standardaction, during which you touch the creature you intend to communicate with.That creature should be able to understand a language you know (otherwise,when the magic is activated, the creatureknows that you sent the message, but hasno idea what the message is). At any timeafterward, you can send your interplanarmessage to that creature.The message pops into the target’smind, awake or asleep, and the targetis aware that the message has beendelivered. If the message arrives whenthe target is asleep, it might appear as avivid dream that the target remembersupon awakening.This spell does not obligate nor forcethe creature you communicate with toact. The target cannot reply to tell you itsplans or intentions. The message travelsthrough the Astral Plane to reach itstarget, so the spell cannot reach planesseparate from (not coterminous to orcoexistent with) the Astral Plane.You can have only one interplanarmessage active at any given time.INTERPLANA</p>

    <p>Your eyes flash green, turning golden asyour survey your opponents. To your eyes,the weakest of them are limned with a palegreen nimbus, which intensifies with power.The most powerful is wrapped in a brilliant,shimmering green aura.This spell evaluates the creatures in thearea and determines the relative powerlevel of each. Creatures are evaluatedas follows.CR 4 or lower 5–10 11–15 StrengthWeakModerateStrong16 or higher OverwhelmingAmong creatures within the same category, you know which is the mostpowerful, but not why. For example,among a group of ogres (CR 2), you wouldknow one of them (an ogre with twolevels of barbarian, CR 4) was the mostpowerful, but not know if it was becausethe ogre had class levels, a template (suchas half-fiendish), or for another reason.Any spell of 3rd level or higher thatprevents scrying attempts on a creature(such as nondetection) or an area (suchas false vision) thwarts this spell’s abilityto evaluate that creature or creatureswithin that area</p>

    <p>You feel your eyes glow with magical energyas you complete the spell. You see luminouswords appear in the air above your spell’starget. The words describe the creature’sstrengths or weaknesses, as you desire.You gauge the strengths and weaknesses of an opponent to gain combatadvantages. Upon casting this spell,you learn a number of strengths orweaknesses of the target equal to one,plus one strength or weakness per twocaster levels (maximum four). You canchoose to learn strengths, weaknesses,or some combination thereof thatyou specify. If a creature has morestrengths or weaknesses than you canlearn with a single casting, you learnthe most powerful ones first. Thus, ifa monster can use finger of death at willand has resistance to sonic 5, you wouldlearn about finger of death first.Strengths can include attack formsand special abilities (including spelllike abilities or supernatural abilities).Weaknesses include vulnerability toan energy type.For example, suppose a 7th-levelcleric casts know opponent on a blackarmored warrior, choosing to learn onestrength and two weaknesses. The warrior fails his save, and the DM informsthe cleric’s player that the opponent hasthe ability to drain energy (a strength),is adversely affected by sunlight, andcan be repelled by a holy symbol (bothweaknesses). The cleric then concludesthat he faces a vampire and breaks outthe wooden stakes.KNO</p>

    <p>Your eyes turn red, then take on a goldenhue. As you look at the creature, you seesmall runes dancing around its head. Eachrune identifies a particular vulnerabilityor resistance—red for resistances, green forvulnerabilities.You learn any special qualities, vulnerabilities, and resistances the targetcreature has. Vulnerabilities includeanything that causes the creature morethan the normal amount of damage(such as a creature with the coldsubtype having vulnerability to fireor a crystalline creature’s susceptibility to the shatter spell). Resistancesinclude any effects that reduce ornegate damage the creature takes andimmunities to particular attacks. Thespell identifies resistances and vulnerabilities granted by spell effects.For example, if cast upon a balor, youlearn that it has damage reduction 15/cold iron and good; spell resistance 28;immunity to poison, fire, and electricity; resistance to acid 10 and cold 10;and that it does not have any particularvulnerabilities</p>

    <p>By waving a scarlet cloth and shoutingtaunts at your intended subject, you gainits undivided attention.You fill the subject with so great arage that it can do nothing but focuson engaging you in personal physicalcombat. The target must be able to seeyou when you cast this spell. If thesubject later loses line of sight to you,the spell immediately ends. (A subjectcan’t voluntarily break line of sightwith you, such as by closing its eyes,to end this spell prematurely.)If the subject threatens you, it mustmake a full attack against you using amelee weapon or a natural weapon. Ifthe subject doesn’t threaten you at thestart of its turn, it must move towardyou (taking nothing but move actions)and end its movement as close to youas possible. If it gets close enough witha single move action to threaten you, itstops and makes a melee attack againstyou as normal.While under the effect of a mindlessrage spell, the subject can make useof all its normal melee combat skills,abilities, and feats—either offensiveor defensive. However, the subjectcan’t make ranged attacks, cast spells,or activate magic items that require acommand word, a spell trigger, or spellcompletion to function. The subjectcan’t make any attack against a creatureother than you.The subject of this spell, thoughovercome with rage, is by no means rendered idiotic or suicidal. For example,an affected creature will not charge offa cliff in an attempt to reach you.An interesting side effect of mindlessrage occurs when the spell affects anycharacter or creature that has the rageability (such as a barbarian). In thesecases, the mindless rage spell automatically activates the creature’s rage ability(and counts as one of the creature’s usesof rage for that day).Focus: A scarlet handkerchief or similar piece of cloth, waved in the target’sdirection while you vocalize the verbalcomponent</p>

If the target creature failsits saving throw, it becomes consumedby a powerful desire for the object. Forthe duration of the spell, the creatureseeks to obtain the object (going sofar as to attack anyone holding orwearing it).Once the creature gains possessionof the object, it protects the item greedily, attacking anyone who approacheswithin 30 feet or who otherwiseappears to be trying to take the objectaway. If no one approaches within 30feet or seems interested in trying totake the object, the subject can actnormally.Dragons, due to their greedy nature,take a –4 penalty on their saving throwsagainst this spell.Material Component: A copper piece</p>

However, if you are proficient with any type of sword, you canwield the beam as if it were any typeof sword and thus gain the benefits ofany special sword skill you might have,such as Weapon Focus.Attacks with a moon blade are meleetouch attacks. Its strike saps vitality orlife force, causing no visible woundsbut dealing 1d8 points of damage +1point per two caster levels (to a maximum of +10) to any type of creatureexcept undead. Undead are visiblywounded by a moon blade. Their substance boils away from its touch, andthey take 2d8 points of damage +1 pointper caster level (to a maximum of +20)per blow. The blade is immaterial, andyour Strength modifier does not applyto the damage.A successful moon blade strike temporarily scrambles magic. On the target’snext turn after a hit from a moon blade,the creature must make a Concentration check to use any spell or spell-likeability. The DC is equal to 10 + damagedealt + spell level.

    <p>As you cast this spell, pure, pale moonlightshapes itself into a stair or bridge, as youdesire.Moon path allows you to create a stair orbridge from one spot to another. Theeffect is a railless ribbon of glowingwhite translucent force like a glassstrip. The strip can be from 3 to 20feet wide as you decide. (You can varythe width over the ribbon’s length ifyou want.) It sticks to its endpointsunshakably, even if these endpointsare in midair.At the time of casting, you designateup to one creature per caster level toreceive extra protection while standing on or moving along the moon path.Protected creatures gain the benefit ofa sanctuary effect. This functions likethe 1st-level spell sanctuary except thatthe save DC is 15 + your Wis modifier, and any subject of the spell whoattacks breaks the sanctuary effect forall subjects. Protected creatures alsostick to the top of the moon path asthough they have received spider climbspells. A creature loses both benefitsimmediately when it leaves the path.Unlike a wall of force, a moon path canbe dispelled. It is otherwise similar toa wall of force in that it needs no supports and it is immune to damage ofall kinds. A disintegrate spell blasts ahole in the path 10 feet square, leavingthe rest of the path intact. (If the moonpath is 10 feet wide or less, this merelycreates a 10-foot gap.) A hit from a rodof cancellation, a sphere of annihilation,or Mordenkainen’s disjunction destroysa moon path. Spells and breath weapons cannot pass through a moon path,although dimension door, teleport, andsimilar effects can bypass the barrier.It blocks ethereal creatures as well asmaterial creatures. Gaze attacks cannotoperate through a moon path.A moon path must be straight, continuous, and unbroken when formed.If its surface would be interrupted byany object or creature, the spell fails.The bridge version of the spell mustbe created flat. The stair version cannotrise or descend any more sharply than45 degrees.Arcane Material Component: A whitehandkerchief</p>

    <p>You summon an avalanche of snow outof a rift in midair, burying your foes andsending them to a frosty death.An obedient avalanche spell affects creatures differently, depending on wherethey are in relation to the avalanche.Within 20 feet of the Center Point:Creatures take 1d8 points of damageper two caster levels (maximum 10d8)and an additional 1d6 points of colddamage per two caster levels. A successful Reflex save halves the damage.Creatures who fail their saves are alsoburied (DMG 90). All squares within 20feet of the center point are covered inheavy snow (DMG 94), which persistsas long as ordinary snow would. Aburied creature can free itself with aDC 20 Strength check as a full-roundaction, and can be dug free by others (asingle creature working alone requires1 minute to free a trapped creature). Atrapped creature is unable to move, andcannot cast spells with somatic components, and any material componentsmust be in hand.Between 20 feet and 40 feet of theCenter Point: Creatures take half asmuch damage from the impact of theavalanche as the creatures nearer thecenter point took (Reflex negates).Creatures who fail their saves must alsoresist the force of the snow moving pastthem as if they were being bull rushed.The snow has a +13 attack bonus (+5for effective Strength of 20 and +8 foreffectively being Huge) on the bullrush check, and it pushes charactersaway from the center point of the spell.All squares in the 20-foot to 40-footring are covered in snow (DMG 94),which persists as long as ordinary snowwould.Terrain and Structures: The avalancheuproots small trees and other vegetation automatically, and it leaves a trailof light rubble (DMG 91) even after thesnow melts. Structures struck by anobedient avalanche take 1d6×10 pointsof damage.An obedient avalanche extinguishesall flames it touches, whether they arenormal or magical</p>

    <p>A brief supplication gives you a vision thathints at how dangerous the immediatefuture is likely to be.Based on an assessment of your immediate surroundings and chosen path oftravel, you receive one of three visionsthat reflect the next hour’s journey:safety, peril, or great danger.The base chance for receiving anaccurate reply is 70% +1% per casterlevel, to a maximum of 90%; the DMmakes the roll secretly.If the omen of peril is successful, youget one of three visions, which lasts justa second or two.r Safety: You aren’t in any immediatedanger. If you continue on your present course (or remain where you areif you have been stationary for sometime before casting the spell), youwill face no significant monsters,traps, or other challenges for thenext hour or so.r Peril: You will face challenges typicalof an adventure: challenging but notoverwhelming monsters, dangeroustraps, and other hazards for the nexthour or so.r Great Danger: Your very life is at graverisk. You will likely face powerfulNPCs or deadly traps in the nexthour.If the roll fails, you get one of the twoincorrect results, determined randomlyby the DM, and you don’t necessarilyknow that you failed because the DMrolls secretly.Choosing which vision is “correct”takes some educated guessworkon the part of the DM, who shouldassess the characters’ likely coursesof action and what dangers they’relikely to face.The exact form that an omen of periltakes depends on whether you worshipa specific deity, venerate nature as adruid, or simply uphold abstract principles. A druid might see a white dovefor safety, a dark cloud obscuring thesun for peril, and a forest fire for greatdanger. A cleric of Fharlanghn mightget a vision of a straight road for safety,a crossroads for peril, and a washed-outbridge for great danger.Unlike the more powerful auguryspell (PH 202), an omen of peril doesn’trespond to a specific question. It indicates only the level of danger likely forthe next hour, not what form the dangerwill take.Focus: A set of marked sticks, bones,or similar tokens worth at least 25 gp</p>

Normally,unless controlled, the Ever-ChangingChaos of Limbo (DMG 158) is just whatthe plane’s name implies: a roiling soupof energy and elements. Natives learnto control it or to inhabit areas thathave enjoyed some measure of controlfor a long period, but visitors to areasof “raw” limbo must make a DC 16Wisdom check to gain control over thedangerous roil.The perinarch spell gives you automatic control of a radius of raw Limbo(an area not already stabilized or withinsome other creature’s control) in closerange. Control allows you to reshapethe raw limbo as you desire, addingA pavilion of grandeur spell provides adventurers with a spectacular resting place between battlesIllus. by B. Haganor subtracting one of the four basicelements once per round as a standardaction. A favorite among travelers fromthe Material Plane is a chunk of earthsurrounded by a small atmosphereof air.The effect of this spell overlapswith the control already (potentially)established with a Wisdom check. Yourallies can give their control over to youconcurrently with the spell beingcast, if they so choose. Controlcannot be wrested away fromyou while the spell is in effect(which is one of the bestreasons to cast this spell, evenif you have a high Wisdom).If you move more than 100feet away from the areathat you controlled, theorder you imposed fadesaway.You are unable to achieveany works of complexitywithin an area you control,but you can mix two or threeelements in a crude fashion;a few examples are providedbelow. You can attempt toseize control of a new area thatalready contains foes; however,foes can make a Reflex save to get outof the area.Thick Barrier: You can “thicken”empty air with dust and rock, creatinga zone around yourself and your alliesthat outside creatures must hack orforce a way through. Their speed dropsto 5 feet, or 10 feet for Large or largercreatures.Fiery Barrier: You can create a thickfield of flame that deals 3d10 points offire damage to any creature attemptingto pass through it. The field also deals3d10 points of fire damage for eachround a creature lingers within it.Complete Barrier: You can create acomplete barrier of solid stone up to 1foot thick encircling yourself and yourallies, preventing access by any otherthan the most accomplished tunnelers.On the other hand, you can attempt totrap foes within their own bubble ofsolid stone</p>

    <p>Reaching into your foe’s mind, you weavean illusion of his most hated foe.You create a phantasmal image of thesubject’s most hated enemy by siftingthrough the subconscious mind ofthe subject. Only you and the spell’ssubject can see the phantasmal creature, and the phantasm seems blurryand indistinct to you. If the target failsits Will saving throw, you designatea space that the phantasm appears tooccupy. The subject must attack thephantasm, or move to be adjacent to it.A creature that attacks the phantasmis allowed an additional saving throwto disbelieve the illusion. If movingup to the phantasm would cause thesubject to cross dangerous terrain (suchas a pool of lava), it does not move tobe adjacent to the phantasm. It merelymoves as close as it can and takes nofurther actions unless the phantasmmoves to a space it can reach.As a move action, you can move aphantasmal decoy up to 60 feet in anydirection.

    <p>You create ever-shifting phantasmal terrainand landmarks that confuse the subjectwhen it tries to move. The very groundshifts and twists beneath the subject’s feet,and the landscape moves of its own accord.The subject finds it nearly impossible to walkin a straight line.The target of a phantasmal disorientationspell must make a Will save after thisspell is cast to discern true landmarksfrom phantasmal ones. If the savesucceeds, the creature moves and actsnormally. If the save fails, it insteadmoves in a direction 90 degrees toeither side (equal chance of going leftor right), and cannot target any creaturewith ranged attacks or ranged spells.Because of the disorientation, thesubject doesn’t realize it’s headed in thewrong direction until it meaningfullyinteracts with its environment (bymaking an attack or manipulating anobject such as a door, for example). Forthe duration of the spell, an affectedcreature must succeed on a Will saveeach round to move normally.A phantasmal disorientation spellaffects only the direction of movementand attacks made at range.

    <p>As you invoke this spell, the spool begins tospin, the thread vanishing as it unravels.There is a wrinkle of force that flashesbriefly; then it evaporates, leaving only thepromise of power behind.An invisible force, not unlike the product of an unseen servant spell (PH 297),comes into being where you wish. Onyour turn, this force steals objects fromothers as you inaudibly direct it (a freeaction). A phantasmal thief can steal anobject from a creature or can pick upan unattended object, as long as theobject weighs no more than 1 poundper caster level. It cannot break intolocked chests. A phantasmal thief hasa Hide modifier (useful against thosewho can see invisible creatures) and aMove Silently modifier both equal toyour caster level.If a phantasmal thief goes undetected,it can steal any object a creature possesses but is not holding or wearing.Even objects in a bag of holding can bestolen. It can steal objects, bring objectsto you, or put them back where theycame from. It can take no other actions.A phantasmal thief needs 1 round to stealan object and another round to bring itto you.A phantasmal thief can hold only oneobject at a time, and the object becomesinvisible in its grasp.A thief cannot take an item if it isdetected by the creature it’s tryingto steal from (with a Listen or Spotcheck). However, the thief can repeatthe attempt in the next round. It cannotbe harmed in any way, although it canbe dispelled.A phantasmal thief can steal an objectfrom a creature’s hand by making a successful disarm attempt. It does so witha bonus on the disarm check equal toyour caster level.

    <p>By waving around a tiny pewter figurineand picturing in your mind the figurineattacking the target creature, you completethe spell. You feel a phantasmal force leapfrom the figurine toward your target.If the target creature fails its savingthrow, this spell creates in the subject’smind an illusory double of whichevercreature currently threatens it that itdeems most dangerous. The form ofthis phantom foe changes as appropriate whenever the target perceives adifferent threatening creature moredangerous than the last. This illusorydouble provides two effects.First, the subject believes it is beingflanked by the phantom foe and thereal creature the foe duplicates. Thus,the duplicated creature is always considered to be flanking the subject inmelee. A creature that can’t be flankedis immune to this aspect of the spell.Second, the subject of the spell isunable to determine that the phantomfoe is not a real threat, and wheneverthe subject attempts to attack thecreature duplicated by the phantom foe,that creature benefits from a 50% misschance against attacks from the subjectof the spell. Because this miss chancecomes from the subject’s inability totell the phantom foe from the original,it is rolled separately from any misschance that applies due to displacementor concealment.Creatures other than the subjectcannot see the phantom foe, althoughthey can attempt to guess its locationby how the target acts. If the subject isnot threatened by any creature at thestart of its turn, the spell ends.Focus: A tiny pewter figure of a warrior that is worth 10 gp.The phantom stag spell provides a druid with a powerful mount to ride into battleIllus. by E.

    <p>As you finish the complicated procedurenecessary to cast the spell, your target’smind opens up to you like a book. You seethe target’s memories like stories and knowthat you can rewrite them as a masterbard rewrites the inferior works of hisapprentices.You can selectively destroy, alter,or implant memories in the subjectcreature as you see fit. Casting the spellgives you access to all of the subject’sthoughts and memories, allowing youto implement as many of the followingspecific effects as you like.Memory Erasure: Memories possessedby the subject can be erased, includingknowledge of specific events, people,or places. You can erase up to one fullweek of memories from the subject’smind.Memory Implant: You can create falsememories in the subject’s mind as yousee fit. You can implant memories ofbeing friends with a hated enemy,events that didn’t really take place, orbetrayals by people the subject regardsas friends.Negative Levels: You can bestow anumber of negative levels equal to 1/2the subject’s character level (roundingdown, minimum 1st level) or less. Thiseffect represents erasure of class knowledge and training. These negative levelsnever become permanent level loss, butthey cannot be removed by spells suchas restoration, instead returning at a rateof one level per day.Persona Rebuilding: By erasing thesubject’s previous personality andimplanting a false set of memories,you can build a new persona for thecreature, altering its alignment, beliefs,values, and personality traits. (Someclass abilities might be affected byalignment changes.)Programmed Trigger: You can programthe subject to delay the onset of any ofthe above effects until a specific eventtakes place, such as the receipt of acoded message, capture by enemies, orarrival at some destination. Similarly,you could specify some or all of thealterations you create in a subject to beremoved by a specific event.The nature of programmed amnesia issuch that a subject given new memories(whether willing or not) might be givencause to suspect that those memoriesare false, based on how complete yourprogramming is. For example, a paladinsubject to a persona rebuilding effectthat changes her alignment to neutralloses her paladin abilities. Unless youimpart a specific believable memory ofwhy she changed alignment, the character will perceive this unexplained gapin her memory and might take steps(such as seeking a magical cure for her“amnesia”) that could negate the spell’seffect (see below).Generally, your subject must beeither willing to undergo the spell orrestrained in some way so that it cannotleave or interfere with the casting. Programmed amnesia cannot be dispelled,and so is normally permanent unlessyou care to specify events that will endthe effect. Its effect can also be removedby a greater restoration, miracle, or wishspell.Material Component: A set of smallcrystal lenses set in gold loops worth500 gp.PROTECTION FRO</p>

    <p>You admonish your chosen subject evenas you offer a supportive slap on the back.With that simple action, you complete thespell and see in your target a realization ofits new abilities.You briefly grant some bard abilities toa creature of your choice. The subjectof the spell can then function as a bardof one-half your current bard level withrespect to bardic music and bardicknowledge. However, protégé impartsno spellcasting ability and does notgrant access to spells not normallyavailable to the subject.

    <p>In casting this spell, you see what others donot—strings of silver energy running fromyour hands and feet to your target’s wristsand ankles. You wave, and she waves back,in an awkward, resisting fashion. You startwalking toward the edge of the cliff. . . .You force the subject to mimic youractions. The subject matches yourmotions exactly, though it takes a –4penalty to Dexterity and Strength.Its movements look awkward, and itsactions aren’t as effective as if it wereactually doing them itself. You can tryto make the subject commit a suicidalact, but it receives another Will save tobreak the spell. If that save is successful, the subject collapses, helpless andin a comatose state, for 1d4 rounds.Anyone observing the subject of thisspell can determine that the subject’sactions are being controlled by makinga DC 15 Sense Motive check (or DC 10if the controlling bard is also visible).This spell doesn’t grant the subjectextraordinary, supernatural, spell-likeabilities, or spellcasting abilities, even ifyou have and use such abilities duringthe spell’s duration</p>

    <p>Water roils and foams as the shipwreck risesto the surface. Floating now effortlessly, itbobs up and down, never sinking morethan an inch.A rainbow blast spell strikes foes with every type of energyIllus. by M. PhillippiThe subject of this spell gains magicalbuoyancy and floats on the surface ofthe water for the duration of the spell,despite its weight or normal buoyancy.It cannot swim below the surface ofthe water. Creatures that must breathewater can still do so. If the subject isunderwater at the time this spell is cast,it rises toward the surface at a speed of150 feet. The magic of the spell preventsthe subject from taking damage fromthe speed of the ascent.This spell is particularly effective atraising sunken ships from the deep.If you know the exact details of theshipwreck (its appearance, its name,the date of its creation, its history, andthe circumstances of its sinking), thevertical distance between you and thesubject is not a factor. When cast toraise a shipwreck, the spell brings upall surviving fragments of the ship,along with any loose objects that arein contact with the ship or enclosedinside it. The ship and its fragmentsremain on the surface of the oceanuntil the spell’s duration ends, at whichpoint the ship sinks again if it has notbeen repaired. (Multiple consecutivecastings of the spell might be neededto keep the ship afloat long enough tobe fully repaired.</p>

    <p>Bringing to your lips some of the mostelemental words of arcane power, you feelstirring within you the spirits of ancientmages as you prepare to absorb the spellenergies you have targeted. Your bodyshakes uncontrollably, as if eagerly anticipating the power behind those spells.This spell functions like dispel magic(PH 223), except that your caster levelfor your dispel check is a maximum of+20 instead of +10, and (as with greaterdispel magic) you have a chance to dispelany effect that remove curse can remove,even if dispel magic can’t dispel thateffect. When casting a targeted dispelor counterspell, you can choose to reaveeach spell you successfully dispel, stealing its power and effect for yourself.When making a targeted dispel, make aSpellcraft check (DC 25 + spell level) toidentify the target spell or each ongoingspell currently in effect on the targetcreature or object.Each spell you dispel with a targeteddispel can be reaved if you so desire,and the spell’s effects are redirectedto you, continuing as if cast on you bythe original caster with no interruptionto or extension of duration. Once youreave the spell, you identify it if youhaven’t done so already (see below).If the subject was the caster and thespell is dismissible, you can dismiss itas if you had cast it yourself. Likewise,if the subject was the caster and thespell requires concentration, you mustconcentrate to maintain the spell’seffect as if you had cast it yourself.You can still attempt to reave a spellyou didn’t identify with your Spellcraftcheck, but doing so can be risky ifyou don’t know the specifics of thespell’s effect. For example, if you fail toidentity an ongoing spell effect on anenemy character and choose to reaveanyway, you might find yourself underthe influence of the dominate personeffect that character was sufferingfrom. Any spell resistance you mighthave has no effect against harmfulspells you might inadvertently reave,but you get the same chance to saveagainst those spell effects as the original target.If you choose to reave a spell you havesuccessfully counterspelled with reaving dispel, you seize control of the spellafter the enemy caster completes it, andyou can redirect the spell to whatevertargets or area you wish (including theoriginal caster, if appropriate). Again,you must make a Spellcraft check (DC25 + spell level) to identify the spellyou intend to reave, but you are freeto choose to redirect a spell whoseeffect, range, and area you don’t know.If the redirected spell’s correct castingconditions aren’t met (because youguess at an improper target or range,for example), the spell fails.pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrsRANDOM PLANAR DESTINATIONSSpells such as prismatic spray, reality maelstrom, and scrambleportal, and items such as an amulet of the planes and a staffof power can send an individual to a random plane. The listof available planes varies according to the cosmology you’vechosen. An example using the DnD cosmology is presentedin the next column.Transitive Planes such as the Ethereal Plane, the Astral Plane,and the Plane of Shadow should not be considered for suchrandom destinations.The layer and exact location on the particular plane is up tothe DM. Transportation to a random plane does not guaranteesurvival there, and individuals who risk such effects should beaware of the dangers.If an individual is someplace other than the Material Planewhen randomly switching planes, simply replace the plane oforigin’s entry on the table with the Material Plane.

The body of the undead tobe revived must be whole. Otherwise,missing parts are still missing whenthe creature is reanimated. None ofthe dead creature’s equipment or possessions are affected in any way by thisspell.An undead that has been destroyedby a turning effect can’t be revived bythis spell.The subject of the spell loses onelevel or Hit Die (if it doesn’t have acharacter class level, it loses a HD) whenit is revived. This level loss cannot berepaired by any spell. If the subject is1st level, it loses 2 points of Charismainstead. An undead that was destroyedwith spells prepared has a 50% chanceof losing any given spell upon beingrevived, in addition to losing spells forlosing a level. A spellcasting undeadcreature that doesn’t prepare spells(such as a sorcerer) has a 50% chance oflosing any given unused spell slot as if ithad been used to cast a spell, in additionto losing spell slots for losing a level.Material Component: A black pearlworth at least 5,000 gp</p>

    <p>After an intonation and clasping of thesubject creature, you grant it knowledge ofwhere safety lies.The recipient of this spell can find theshortest, most direct direction to a placeof safety, with safety being defined asa location where the individual is nottaking immediate damage from theenvironment, and immediate damageis not imminent. It does not providethe means for the subject to move inthat direction.A safety spell points out the shortestdistance out of a poisonous cloud, orthe direction one should dig to reachthe surface if entombed in earth. Itdoes not function against the mazespell, because that spell deals no physical damage. Nor does the spell provideknowledge of or protection againstthe creatures that inhabit those safeplaces.In the DnD cosmology (DMG 150),safety has the following effects whencast on specific planes.Plane of Shadow: Shortest route out ofdarklands.Elemental Plane of Air: Nearest windproof shelter, shortest route out ofsmoke bank.Elemental Plane of Earth: Nearest airpocket or open cavern.Elemental Plane of Fire: Shortest routeout of magma pools or other unusuallyhot places.Elemental Plane of Water: Nearestpocket of breathable air; shortest routeout of hot spot, ice pocket, or red tide.Negative Energy Plane: Nearestdoldrum area with the minor negativedominant trait.Positive Energy Plane: Nearest edgezone with the minor positive-dominanttrait.Limbo: Nearest area of stabilizedlimbo.Pandemonium: Nearest shelter froma windstorm.Carceri: Shortest route out of a Minethys sandstorm.Gehenna: Nearest flat ledge, nearestshelter from Mungoth’s acidic snow.Nine Hells: Nearest shelter fromfireballs on Avernus, rockslides onMalbolge, or cold on Cania.Acheron: Nearest shelter from Ocanthus bladestorms.On planes you create yourself, safetymight provide other information.This spell is mostly used in hostileenvironments, such as one of the InnerPlanes, to locate the nearest pocket ofhabitable space.If safety is cast and then followed by aplane shift spell (PH 262), the plane shiftsends the subject of safety to a placeof relative safety on that plane.

    <p>By infusing the nearby landscape withpower stolen from the Plane of Shadow,you make the surrounding terrain a moresavage, dangerous place.The spell’s exact effects vary with theterrain upon which it is cast.Desert: The spell transforms a desertinto a place where no one goes willingly.The average temperature increases by30 degrees, or decreases by 30 degreesif the desert is actually a tundra (seeCold Dangers and Heat Dangers, DMG302–303). Sandstorms (or snowstormsif in a tundra) blow through a shadowlandscape desert on an hourly basis.Forest: Forests augmented with ashadow landscape spell become frightening places where a canopy of rottingleaves blocks the sun and all the treesare strangely twisted. Spaces with lightundergrowth have heavy undergrowthinstead, and spaces covered with heavyundergrowth grasp at passersby as if anentangle spell (PH 227) had been caston them (save DC equal to the shadowlandscape’s DC).Hill: Even gentle hills become moretreacherous under the effect of a shadowlandscape spell. Light undergrowthbecomes heavy undergrowth in hillterrain, and slopes seem steeper thantheir elevation would indicate. It takes2 squares of movement to move uphillon a gradual slope, and 4 squares tomove uphill on a steep slope. Cliffshave frequent overhangs and are madeof crumbling rock, requiring a DC 25Climb check to ascend or descend.Marsh: Marshes seem swampier andmore forbidding. Half the undergrowthspaces in the marsh become quicksand(DMG 88).Mountain: The mountains becomeplaces of jagged peaks, slippery slopes,and howling winds. Cliffs and chasmsrequire a DC 25 Climb check to scale.Creatures who fail Climb checks ormake loud noises have a 10% chanceof starting an avalanche (DMG 90).Altitude effects are one category worse:areas lower than 5,000 feet are treated asthe 5,000- to 15,000-foot category, andanything above 5,000 feet is treated asbeing above 15,000 feet.The shadow landscape spell brings a bit of the Plane of Shadow to the Material PlaneIllus. by B. HaganPlain: Only natural grasslands changeas a result of shadow landscape, but theybecome wide-open spaces with standsof thick bushes where thunderstormsand tornados are frequent. Half thespaces with undergrowth (light orheavy) grasp at passersby as if anentangle spell (PH 227) had been caston them (save DC equal to the shadowlandscape’s DC).Underground: Ordinary dungeonsaren’t affected by shadow landscape,but naturally occurring caverns are.Natural stone floors take 4 squares ofmovement per space to enter. Stalagmites cover 10% of the available floorspace.In addition to terrain-specific effects,a shadow landscape spell worsens theweather within the spell’s area. Whenrolling random weather (DMG 94), rolltwice and take the higher result. Inplains terrain, roll three times and takethe highest result.

When you castshadow landscape, you can designate onecreature per four caster levels as a designated traveler. Creatures so designateddon’t suffer the terrain-specific effectsof the spell, but they’re still subject tothe bad weather.You can also designate one or moreanimals, plants, or magical beastsnative to the spell’s area as shadowguardians of the landscape. You candesignate 1 HD of creatures per casterlevel, split up however you like. Forexample, a 20th-level druid could designate two treants (7 HD each) and adire wolf (6 HD) as shadow guardians.As long as the designated guardiansremain within the spell’s area, theyhave a friendly attitude toward youand the travelers you have designated,and they also gain the followingspecial qualities: resistance to cold10, darkvision out to 60 feet, damagereduction 5/magic, evasion, and lowlight vision.

The illusory path starts at a pointchosen by you within the range of thespell. It continues in the direction youindicate, to the limit of the spell’s area,where it ends abruptly. The illusorypath avoids obstacles and provides nobridges, stairs, ladders, ramps, or othermethods of traversing such obstacles.There is no way to force the illusorypath to lead over a cliff or across a rivermore than 4 feet deep.Those who fail their Will savesstruggle along the illusory path. Ifvegetation or rough terrain slowstheir progress, they believe the path issloping enough to justify the reducedspeed.

PolakThis spell lends fuel to existing fireswithin the spell’s area, allowing themto burn off the intangible power ofpassion as much as from physicalsubstance. Because these fires consumeless of the physical fuel that sustainthem, they burn for twice as longwithout losing any of their intensity,but their illumination radius is halved.In addition, an affected fire is muchharder to extinguish. It takes twiceas long to put out a fire that is underthe effect of this spell, and if a rollis required (such as the Reflex saverequired to extinguish flames if acreature is on fire), two successful rollsover 2 rounds are required to successfully put out the fire. If one such rollfails, the creature must begin trying toextinguish the flames again as if it hadnever succeeded on the first roll.Magical fire used against a target inthis spell’s area, such as from a produceflame or fireball spell, does not burn aseffectively, and fire damage from suchsources is reduced by 1 point per die.Slow burn counters or dispels theeffect of raging flame (page 164).Arcane Material Component: An oilfilled hourglass</p>

It takesno actions, not even purely mentalactions, and instead watches the worldaround it with bemusement. The subject becomes effectively helpless andtakes no steps to defend itself from anythreat, since it considers any hostileaction merely another illusion</p>

    <p>A touch from your hand outlines an undeadcreature in a faint yellow glow, making itvulnerable to many of the dangers that canharm living creatures.For the duration of the spell, theundead creature is subject to extradamage from critical hits (and thussneak attacks), nonlethal damage,ability drain, energy drain, fatigue,exhaustion, and damage to its physicalability scores (though it still lacks aConstitution score and thus can’t takeConstitution damage) as if it were alive.It loses its immunity to effects thatrequire a Fortitude save, as well as itsinvulnerability to poison, sleep effects,paralysis, stunning, disease, and deatheffects. However, an undead affected bythis spell gains a bonus on its Fortitudesaves equal to its Charisma bonus(if any). (The bonus doesn’t apply toFortitude saves against effects that alsoaffect objects.) It must breathe, eat, andsleep just like a normal living creature(though the last two aren’t likely tocome into play thanks to the spell’sshort duration).While it is under the effect of thisspell, both negative energy (suchas inflict spells) and positive energy(such as cure spells) heal damage to theundead creature, rather than damaging it.An undead creature affected by thisspell retains all of its other traits</p>

    <p>Joining mysterious phrases with the simplemotion of flexing your fingers, you imbueyour hands with receptive magical energythat crackles and glows a soft orange.You are able to hold the charge for onetouch spell per arm of your body as longas you don’t use a charged limb to castanother spell or touch anythingwith it. Each touch spell youcast resides in a different forelimb. For the duration of thisspell, any touch spells you castare discharged only if youcast another spell with thatforelimb or touch somethingwith that forelimb.For example, a humansorcerer casts this spell,then casts chill touch andholds the charge in his lefthand, then casts shockinggrasp and holds the charge inhis right hand. Because ofthe spell flower, he can holdthe charge on both of thesespells at the same time. Ifhe casts another spell witha somatic component (whichrequires the use of one of hishands), he immediately losesone of his held touch spells(his choice), but if the spell hecasts is also a touch spell, he canimmediately hold the charge inthe available hand. If he chooses toattack with a touch spell, it worksnormally. Since he has multiplelimbs that are considered armed, hecan make an off-hand attack withthe other touch spell in thesame round, with the normalpenalties for fighting with twoweapons (PH 160).A spectral weapon appears fearsomeat first glanceIllus. by D. MartinA marilith spellcaster could do thesame as the sorcerer in the previousexample, except that she could holdthe charge on up to six touch spells.She could also use any of her spell-likeor supernatural abilities, since those donot interfere with holding a charge.If the spell flower effect ends, themost recent touch spell cast remains asa held charge and all other held spellsdissipate.SPELL IMMUNITY</p>

    <p>You call upon the power of the dinosaurs tocomplete the spell. A set of ghostly dinosaurjaws comes into being and attacks thecreature you designate.This spell creates a set of powerful jawsof force. The jaws attempt to grapple thedesignated opponent, starting with oneattack in the round the spell is cast andcontinuing each round thereafter. Thejaws use your base attack bonus (possibly allowing them multiple attacksper round in subsequent rounds) + yourWis modifier as their attack bonus. Ifan initial attack hits, the jaws deal 2d6points of damage and attempt to starta grapple as a free action. The jaws’bonus on grapple checks is equal totheir attack bonus + 4.Once the opponent is grappled, thejaws deal 2d6 points of damage witheach subsequent grapple check. Thetarget is considered to be grapplingand cannot move; it no longer threatenssquares and loses its Dexterity bonus toAC against opponents not grappling it.The jaws always strike from yourdirection. They do not get a bonus forflanking or help a combatant get one.Your feats do not affect the jaws. If thejaws move beyond the range of thespell, they vanish. As a magical forceeffect, the jaws cannot be damaged,but disintegrate or a sphere of annihilationdestroys the effect.The grappled target can cast a spellonly if it has no somatic component,the material components are in hand,and a Concentration check (DC 20 +spell level) is made. A creature grappledby the jaws can attempt to escape bysucceeding on a grapple check againstthe jaws or by making a successfulEscape Artist check as a standard actionopposed by the jaws’ grapple check.As a free action, you can direct thejaws to pin a grappled opponent insteadof dealing damage with a grapplecheck. If the jaws win the opposedgrapple check, the opponent is pinned.A pinned opponent is immobile andmust break the pin before it can escapethe grapple. Creatures other than thosegrappling the pinned target gain a +4bonus on attack rolls to hit it. If the jawshave multiple attacks, you can use themto damage a pinned target or to makemore grapple attempts against it.Each round after the first, you can usea move action to direct the jaws to a newtarget. If you do not, the jaws continueto attack the previous round’s target. Onany round that the jaws switch targets,they get one attack. Subsequent roundsof attacking that target allow the jawsto make multiple attacks if your baseattack bonus would allow it.If you become unable to commandthe jaws, they vanish.Material Component: A piece of bonefrom a dinosaur’s jaw</p>

The victimalso takes a –2 penalty to AC.In addition, if the victim attemptsto cast a spell, it must succeed on aConcentration check with a DC equalto the sting ray’s DC + the level of thespell the subject is attempting to cast.For example, if a 6th-level sorcererwith a Charisma score of 16 casts stingray on a wizard casting a fireball, theConcentration check DC is 19 (16 [stingray DC] + 3 [fireball spell level]).A successful Will save negates theeffect restricting the subject’s actionto one move or one standard actioneach round, nor does the subject needto make a Concentration check eachtime it wishes to cast a spell.

However, if the subjectgains at least as many negative levels asit has Hit Dice, it dies.If the sword strikes an undead creature, it grants that creature 5 temporaryhit points per two caster levels (maximum 25 temporary hit points) that lastfor up to 1 hour.Material Component: A bastard swordor longsword, which is shatteredagainst a stone while casting the spell</p>

    <p>Swinging a miniature replica of a swordas if it were real, you bring into being afull-sized representation of your replicamade entirely of pale green force. The bladeimmediately attacks your enemy.You cause a blade of pale green forceto appear and strike the opponent youdesignate, starting with one attack inthe round when the spell is cast andcontinuing each round thereafter.Though it makes regular melee attacks,the sword strikes as a spell, not aweapon (and so can strike incorporealcreatures). A sword of deception alwaysstrikes from your direction, and so itcan’t be used to flank with your attacks,but it could flank with your allies.The blade attacks with a base attackbonus equal to your caster level, dealing1d8 points of damage per hit and threatening a critical hit on a roll of 19–20. Inaddition, each successful hit provides a–2 penalty on the target’s next savingthrow roll (–4 on a successful criticalhit). This penalty is cumulative (to amaximum of –5 on a single creature)and lasts until the creature is forcedto make a saving throw in a dangeroussituation or receives the benefit of aremove curse spell.Each round, a sword of deception continues to attack the previous round’starget unless you use a standard actionto switch it to a new target withinrange. In any round when the weaponswitches targets, it gets one attack as astandard action (as it does in the roundwhen the spell is cast). The weaponcan make multiple attack rolls againsta single target with a full attack actionif its base attack bonus permits. A swordof deception cannot be attacked or damaged (though it can be dispelled as anyother spell).If an attacked creature has spellresistance, make a caster level checkthe first time the sword attacks. Ifthe check is successful, the sword canattack that creature with normal effectfor the duration of the spell. If not, thesword of deception is dispelled. If thetarget goes beyond the spell range orout of your sight, the sword of deceptionreturns to you and hovers.Focus: A miniature replica of a swordand a set of loaded dice</p>

    <p>A dark and ominous aura forms aroundyou as you complete the spell. Distant chordsof a harsh and terrible symphony—as ifmultiple orchestras played different piecessimultaneously—echo continuously in theair as you reach for your victim.A creature targeted by this spell losesthe ability to dream during sleep orrest. Rather, in place of dreams, thesubject’s slumbering mind is filledwith the sounds of a discordant orchestra. After the victim’s first attemptto sleep, it incurs a –2 penalty onWisdom-based skill checks. This penalty persists as long as the symphonicnightmare maintains its hold. Thisspell affects all creatures that sleepor enter sleeplike trances, althoughcreatures without the need to sleep areeffectively immune.In addition, the creature’s sleep isnow haunted. It can no longer gaincomplete rest from sleeping or resting.The subject does not regain hit pointsor heal ability damage naturally, noris it able to prepare spells if doing sorequires a full night’s rest.The creature is, however, now immune to the dream and nightmare spells,as well as to other effects that causenightmares (such as the night hag’sdream haunting ability).You can lift the effect of this curseat will, but it is otherwise difficult toremove a symphonic nightmare beforeits duration expires. A remove cursecast at a higher caster level than thesymphonic nightmare spell removes it,as does a successful break enchantment.Otherwise, a wish or miracle is requiredto lift the curse.This spell can also be cast on a creature you are scrying, or on a creaturedistant from you if you hold somethingthe creature carried within the past 24hours.Focus: A small statue of an openedskull, within which is arranged aminiature orchestra.

    <p>Mimicking the marks of the sigil on theslate you hold, you render yourself immuneto detection by the magic symbol.You place a protective spell uponyour hand that allows you to touchan untriggered magic sigil (such asa glyph of warding or a symbol of death)without setting it off. The touched sigilis removed from its location and heldas magical potential on your hand, asthough it were a touch spell.To pick up a sigil in this manner,you must make a successful caster levelcheck (DC 20 + the target glyph’s spelllevel). Failure indicates that you havetriggered the glyph or symbol. If yousuccessfully transfer the sigil to yourhand, you can use a standard action toplace it on a surface (not a creature) ofthe sort on which it can normally bescribed. The transferred sigil worksnormally thereafter and retains allits original triggering conditions,although its current location mightmake its triggers difficult or impossibleto achieve.You can maintain the magic sigil onyour hand as long as you concentrate.If your concentration lapses or thespell duration expires while the sigil isthus stored as potential, it immediatelytriggers upon you (and only you), evenif you normally would not meet itstrigger conditions. The effect has thesame saving throw and spell resistanceas the original spell did. The only safeway to rid yourself of the stored sigilis to place it upon a suitable surface.Focus: A piece of slate that has beenscoured bare and smooth on one side</p>

    <p>With a declaration, youfinish your casting. Immediately, beings in the affected areacease moving, standing as stillas statues.This spell causes any Medium or smaller humanoidswithin the area of the spellto become paralyzed. Whencasting the spell, you must specify a condition that will end it (“Waithere until the dragon arrives”), evenif that condition can never feasibly bemet (“Stay here until the sun shinesat night”). Subjects in the area thatfail their saves immediately becomeaware of the condition, but they cannotcommunicate it due to their paralyzedstate (although someone could use aspell such as detect thoughts to ascertain the condition). For every hourthe creatures are transfixed before thecondition is met, they are allowed another saving throw to break free of thespell’s effect.As long as the spell operates, anyMedium or smaller humanoid thatenters its area must make a successfulsaving throw or become transfixedwith the same exit conditions (they toobecome aware of the exit conditions onbecoming transfixed).

The tsunamistarts at any point you select withinrange of the spell and then moves at aspeed of 60 feet in any direction chosenby you. Once the direction is set, thetsunami cannot change course. Thetsunami deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per caster level (maximum20d6) to all in its path. Anything struckcan make a Fortitude saving throwfor half damage. Gargantuan or largercreatures that fail the save are knockedprone. Huge or smaller creatures thatfail the save are picked up and carriedwith the wave. Each round a victimis carried by the tsunami, it takes thebludgeoning damage again and canmake an additional Fortitude save forhalf damage. Creatures being carriedby a tsunami cannot move in any otherway. They can otherwise act normally,but must make a Concentration check(DC 20 + spell level) to cast a spell.Creatures caught in a tsunami take a–4 penalty to Dexterity and a –2 penalty on attack rolls. They can escapethe wave by making successful DC20 Swim checks, as long as they endtheir movement outside the effect ofthe tsunami.Any creature that comes in contactwith a tsunami as a result of movement during its turn is consideredto have been struck by the tsunami’smovement. A creature can attempt toextract another creature caught by atsunami, providing the rescuer resistsbeing swept up or knocked down bythe tsunami and can reach the victimExtracting a victim in this mannerrequires a DC 20 Strength check.A tsunami’s progress can be halted byanything that would normally blockline of effect along its path, assuming the tsunami does not destroy theintervening object or creature. If onlya portion of the tsunami is blocked, therest of it continues on.Although this spell can be cast ondry land, it is most effective when caston the open sea. In this case, savingthrows to avoid full damage are madewith a –4 penalty, and the width of thetsunami increases to 40 feet per casterlevel. A tsunami that begins on waterbut then travels onto land immediatelyshrinks to its land size and speed.

It turns intoa 5-foot-wide glob of dripping, green-graygoo, and the sticky mass rockets towardyour target.When you attack with a viscid glob, youmake a ranged touch attack againstthe target. If you miss, the glob mightstrike a nearby square or creature (seeMissing with a Thrown Weapon, PH158). Once you have established thedirection of the miss, roll 1d4 to determine the number of squares away fromthe target square that the glob lands.A Medium or smaller creaturestruck by the glob must make a successful Reflex save or be instantlystuck in place. A stuck creature canspeak but is otherwise limited topurely mental actions (such as castingspells with no somatic or materialcomponents) and attempts to freeitself by means of a Strength checkor Escape Artist check (against a DCequal to this spell’s DC) made as afull-round action. A Large or largercreature stuck in the goo can’t movefrom the spot where it is glued, but itcan otherwise act normally.The glob dissipates when thespell duration expires. Until then,it remains sticky, and any creaturetouching it (for example, a creatureattempting to pull out an ally) mustmake a successful Reflex save orbecome stuck itself. A creature stuckby such secondary contact is nottrapped as thoroughly as a creaturetargeted by the glob, however, so theDC of the Strength check or EscapeArtist check required to get free isreduced by 5.Material Component: A tiny ball ofspider silk</p>

Once cast, the wallis immobile. The sand is sufficientlythick to block ranged attacks, providing normal cover appropriate for itssize, but creatures can attempt toforce their way through it. Movingthrough a wall of sand is difficult,requiring a full-round action and aStrength check. A creature moves 5feet through a wall of sand for every5 points by which its Strength checkresult exceeds 10.Creatures within a wall of sand areconsidered blinded and deafened, andthey are unable to speak or breathe.Thus, they might begin to suffocate(DMG 304) if they remain withinthe wall too long. Spells with verbalcomponents cannot be cast withinthe wall, and any other spell requiresa successful Concentration check (DC20 + spell level).Creatures with reach can attemptto attack through the wall, but targetshave total concealment and total cover,and the attacker must have a generalidea where the target is located.Any open, unprotected flame thrustinto a wall of sand is instantly extinguished.Arcane Material Component: A handful of sand</p>

With a touch, youtransfer the glow from your hand onto theintended weapon.You cause a weapon to gain the abilityto deal energy damage in addition to itsother abilities, similar to how a flamingburst weapon deals extra fire damageon a hit or a critical hit. The weaponcan deal acid, cold, electricity, or firedamage, chosen by you at the time ofcasting. The weapon deals an extra1d6 points of damage of that energytype on a successful hit. On a criticalhit, the weapon deals an additional1d10 points of energy damage. If theweapon’s critical multiplier is ×3, add2d10 points of energy damage instead,and if the multiplier is ×4, add 3d10points of energy damage.This spell can be cast on a weaponthat already deals energy damage,and if the weapon already createsthe same type of damage as the spell,the effects stack. For example, if caston a +1 flaming longsword to give itadditional fire damage, the weaponnow deals an extra 2d6 points of firedamage per hit.This spell has a descriptor that isthe same as the energy created by thetarget weapon.

    <p>Wind whips into a frenzy and becomes atornado that wreaks destruction as youdirect, flinging your foes into the air anddestroying nearby structures.This spell is a more potent version ofwhirlwind (PH 301). A greater whirlwindaffects creatures differently, dependingon their size and where they are inrelation to the twister.Near the Tornado: Large or smallercreatures who start their turn within 60feet of the center of a greater whirlwindmust succeed on a Fortitude save or bedragged 1d4×10 feet toward the centerof the twister, taking 1d4 points ofnonlethal damage per 10 feet dragged.Huge creatures within 40 feet of thetwister must succeed on a Fortitudesave or be knocked prone. Gargantuanand Colossal creatures within 40 feetof the twister must succeed on a Fortitude save before moving away from thetwister.Flying creatures of Huge size orsmaller that fail their Fortitude savesare sucked to the center of the twister,taking 2d6 points of damage from thebattering and buffeting. Gargantuanflying creatures must succeed on aFortitude save or be pulled 1d6×10 feettoward the center of the twister. Colossal flyers must likewise make Fortitudesaves or be pulled 1d6×5 feet toward thetwister’s center.Any Huge or smaller creature thatcomes in contact with the spell effectmust succeed on a Reflex save or take3d6 points of damage. A Large orsmaller creature that fails its first savemust succeed on a second one or bepicked up bodily by the cyclone andheld suspended in its powerful winds.Any creature picked up is ejected 3rounds later.Inside the Tornado: Creatures that starttheir turn inside the tornado take 6d6points of damage for each round theyremain inside at the beginning of yourturn. Creatures inside the tornadocan’t do much; attacks, spellcasting,and movement are impossible withina greater whirlwind. When the greaterwhirlwind ejects a creature, it reappears4d6×5 feet away from the twister’scenter in a random direction, and 4d6×5feet off the ground (immediately fallingif it can’t fly).Terrain and Structures: The tornadouproots trees and other vegetationautomatically, and it leaves a trail ofdense rubble (DMG 90) wherever itgoes. Structures within a greater whirlwind take 2d6×10 points of damage perround. In a round or two, that amountof damage is sufficient to destroy anybuilding made of materials less sturdythan reinforced masonry.No ranged attacks can pass throughthe twister. A greater whirlwind extinguishes all flames it touches. Listenchecks are impossible within a greaterwhirlwind.A greater whirlwind remains stationary unless you direct it elsewhere as amove action.
